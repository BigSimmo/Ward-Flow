/**
 * THE MOCKUPS BOUNDARY — one segment above every design-scratch route, INCLUDING the two Ward Flow
 * boundaries nested below it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE GAP THIS CLOSES.** `ward-flow/error.tsx`'s own doc comment named this exact file as the
 * fix and recorded rather than attempted it. Per Next 16's `file-conventions/error.md`: "It does
 * **not** wrap the `layout.js`... above it in the same segment." `ward-flow/error.tsx` and
 * `ward-flow/layout.tsx` are siblings in the same segment, so nothing placed anywhere inside that
 * folder could ever catch a throw out of `ward-flow/layout.tsx` itself —
 * `DeveloperAreaGate`, `WardFlowProvider`, or the reducer's `useReducer` initialiser
 * (`seedWardFlowStateAt`). Because this file lives one segment further up, at `mockups/`,
 * `ward-flow/layout.tsx` is a NESTED layout relative to it and IS wrapped ("error.js wraps... nested
 * layout.js files"). A throw from any of those three now lands here instead of replacing the whole
 * document via `src/app/error.tsx`. The same reasoning closes the identical gap for
 * `mockups/care-plan/layout.tsx` and `mockups/caring-contacts/layout.tsx`, which follow the same
 * gate-then-provider shape and previously had no nearer boundary either.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHAT IT STILL CANNOT COVER — read this before assuming the gap is fully closed.**
 *   - `ward-movements.ts` builds its seeded movements at MODULE scope
 *     (`export const wardMovements = [...]`), so the "unhandled movement stage" guard can throw
 *     during module evaluation, before React has rendered anything for any boundary to wrap. No
 *     error boundary anywhere in the tree — not this one, not one nearer, not one further out — can
 *     catch a throw that happens before rendering starts.
 *   - This file sits INSIDE `mockups/layout.tsx`'s own segment, so — by the identical same-segment
 *     rule that created the original gap — it does NOT wrap `mockups/layout.tsx` or the
 *     `MockupsLayoutClient` component that layout renders. A throw from either of those (for example
 *     out of the `mockupsEnabled()` / `headers()` gate) still escapes to `src/app/error.tsx`, the
 *     application shell's boundary.
 *   - It does not wrap `src/app/layout.tsx` or anything above it. Only a root `global-error.tsx`
 *     could catch that, and this task does not add one.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS BOUNDARY IS INHERITED BY EVERY ROUTE UNDER `mockups/`, NOT ONLY WARD FLOW.** Nothing
 * else in this folder declares a nearer `error.tsx`, so a render throw in any other design-scratch
 * route (`document-search`, `calculators-*`, `favourites-*`, and the rest) is now caught here too,
 * where it previously fell through to `src/app/error.tsx`. That is a deliberate, reported
 * consequence of placing the boundary at this level, not a scoping decision made unilaterally. The
 * copy below is therefore written for a design-scratch route in general, not for Ward Flow
 * specifically, and it does not reuse `WardFlowErrorPanel`: `tests/ward-flow-seam.test.ts` forbids
 * anything outside Ward Flow's own folders from importing its code ("has nothing outside it
 * importing ward code"), so this panel is independent by construction, not by stylistic choice.
