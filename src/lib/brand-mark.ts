// Single source of truth for the brand mark: the PsychSift S — two

// geometry here so the favicon, the in-app <BrandMark>, the browser-tab icon
// (app/icon.svg), and the generated app-icon / maskable / OG image routes can
// never drift apart.
//
// The construction is recorded in docs/brand/brand-mark.md and the master
// artwork lives in public/brand/. Do not re-draw the paths below by hand: they
// are the exact output of that construction, and the two strokes are one path
// and its point reflection, which is what keeps the cut between them parallel.
//
// Pure data + strings (no JSX, no imports) so it is consumable everywhere: the
// React <BrandMark> renders the exported geometry as JSX; scripts/generate-
// brand-assets.ts writes app/icon.svg from brandIconSvg(); the next/og image
// routes embed brandMarkSvg() as a data: URI.

 *  Not a new measurement. The brand doc fixes the two ink boxes: the primary

 *  span the same 0 to 100.38 vertically. Every placement here centres that box
 *  in the 512 viewBox, which is verifiable against the three transforms above —
 *  each lands its centre on 256.000 to within 0.003, the rounding of a
 *  two-decimal box figure.
 *
 *  Two consequences, and both are why this is a derivation rather than a redraw:
 *
 *  The vertical extent is identical between the variants (the point slides
 *  sideways; its cy and r do not move), so the scale is unchanged at 5.1006 —
 *  100.3813 x 5.1006 = 512.0, the bare variant's whole point.
 *
 *  The point moves exactly 10 units out and is the box's right edge, so the box
 *  widens by exactly 10 and its centre by exactly 5. The placement therefore
 *  shifts left by 5 glyph units at this scale: 114.8907 - 5 x 5.1006 = 89.3877.
 *  The same arithmetic reproduces the committed tiled pair (143.1125 - 5 x
 *  4.0804 = 122.7103, as shipped), which is the check that the rule is the one
 *  actually used rather than one that merely fits.
 *
 *  It travels with BRAND_STROKE_PATH_SMALL and BRAND_POINT_SMALL as a set. The
 *  doc is explicit that mixing one variant's point with the other's placement
 *  puts the glyph off-centre; `brandMarkOptics()` below is the only supported
 *  way to pick, so a caller cannot half-apply the variant. */
