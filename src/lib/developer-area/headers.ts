 *
 *  ⚠️ `/mockups/ward-flow-sign-in` is listed SEPARATELY for exactly that reason: it is a sibling
 *  of the ward-flow subtree, not a child, so the `/mockups/ward-flow` entry does not cover it —
 *  the next character is a hyphen, not a slash. It cannot simply move under `/mockups/ward-flow/`
 *  either, because that segment's layout mounts the rail, bar and provider around every nested
 *  route with no per-route opt-out, and a sign-in screen is specified to have none of them. Any
 *  future `/mockups/ward-flow-*` sibling needs its own line here; a new directory INSIDE
 *  `/mockups/ward-flow/` does not.
 *
 *  🔴 Keep this note ABOVE the array and never inside it. `readDeveloperGatedPrefixes` in
 *  `scripts/check-mockup-retirement.mjs` extracts every quoted or backticked span between the
 *  brackets, so a comment placed among the entries turns each of its code spans into a phantom
 *  prefix — measured 2026-09-12, when doing so reddened two retirement gates at once. */
