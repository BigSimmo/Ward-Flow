 * Passwordless, link-based access to the developer-gated `/mockups` subtrees.

 * The owner asked for a Developer Section that does not ask him to sign in, and
 * the two obvious answers were both wrong. Deleting `DeveloperAreaGate` would
 * publish the task ledger, the hazard notes, and the Ward Flow / Care Plan /
 * Caring Contact prototypes to anyone who visits `psychiatry.tools` — that is
 * exactly #L30, reintroduced deliberately. Keeping only the Supabase sign-in
 * leaves the magic-link round trip he asked to be rid of.
 *
 * So this is a third credential, alongside the administrator claim and never
 * replacing it: a secret carried in the URL once, exchanged by `src/proxy.ts`
 * for a long-lived signed cookie, after which the subtree opens with no
 * interaction at all on that device.
 *
 * **The cookie is not the key.** It carries an HMAC-SHA256 signature over its
 * own issue time, keyed by `DEVELOPER_AREA_ACCESS_KEY`, so a stolen cookie
 * cannot be turned back into the key, and rotating the key in Railway revokes
 * every device at once — the only revocation this design has, which is why it
 * is written down here rather than left to be rediscovered.
 *
 * **It fails closed in every unset or under-strength case.** No key configured,
 * a key below `MIN_DEVELOPER_ACCESS_KEY_LENGTH`, a malformed token, a token
 * signed under a different key: all resolve to "not granted", and the visitor
 * gets the ordinary sign-in screen. A short key is rejected rather than
 * accepted-with-a-warning because this secret travels in a URL, where it is
 * visible in a browser's history and in any screen share.
