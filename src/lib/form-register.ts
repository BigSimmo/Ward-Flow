/**
 * The Chief Psychiatrist's official forms register, and the one lookup that turns a form code
 * into its official title.
 *
 * **A LEAF MODULE ON PURPOSE.** This file imports nothing, so Ward Flow's screens (all
 * `"use client"` components) can use it without pulling any other code into the client bundle.
 * It must stay that way: a value import here would undo the reason the file exists. It was split
 * out of PsychSift's forms catalogue on 2026-08-24 for exactly that reason. The catalogue, its data
 * files and its form ranker were removed with PsychSift (26 September 2026), so **this is the only
 * copy of the register.**
 *
 * The register is transcribed from
 * https://www.chiefpsychiatrist.wa.gov.au/laws-and-rights/legislation/mental-health-act-2014-forms/
 * (last checked against it on 17 July 2026, the date the removed catalogue recorded). Nothing
 * here may be invented, inferred or "corrected": a code the register does not list has no title,
 * and `formTitleForCode` returns `null` for it rather than guessing.
