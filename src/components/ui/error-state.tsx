/**
 * COMPONENTS §0.3 and SPEC §10, "Search failed → `ErrorState`", with the copy
 * rule stated as a prohibition: **never "0 matches" after a failed request**.
 *
 * The distinction this component exists to hold is not cosmetic. A search that
 * failed has no count to report, so reporting zero is a false statement about
 * the corpus rather than a tidy fallback — on the services page "0 matches"
 * asserts there are no crisis services when the search never ran, and on
 * favourites it reads as "you have saved nothing" rather than "we could not
 * load them". `MissingValue` draws the same line from the other side: "no
 * result count is available" is not a missing value.
 *
 * So the component takes **no count and no children**. There is no prop through
 * which a number can arrive, which is the only version of this rule that
 * survives a hurried call site. The one remaining route — a caller writing the
 * count into `title` or `body` themselves — is covered by a development-time
 * tripwire below rather than by trust.
 *
 * Six surfaces hand-roll this guard today, several with comments explaining the
 * rule (`search-results-header-band.tsx`, `services-navigator-page.tsx`,
 * `favourites-command-library-page.tsx`, `document-search-results.tsx`, and the
 * differentials pages). They are correct; they are simply not shared. Adopting
 * them is a live-look change and deliberately not part of landing this.

 * clinical surface that copy can quote the query — "0 results for <query>".
 * Echoing it to the production console makes a copy defect into a disclosure
 * risk, and nobody reads a production browser console for design-system
 * warnings anyway. An unset `NODE_ENV` is treated as production: fail quiet.
 *
 * The rule is an exported predicate rather than an inline comparison because a
 * comparison is untestable here: Vite statically replaces `process.env.NODE_ENV`
 * inside `src/` modules, so under Vitest the check compiles to
 * `"test" === "development"` and no `stubEnv` can move it. A console spy
 * therefore proves nothing about production either way — it stays silent for
 * the wrong reason. The predicate is tested directly instead.
