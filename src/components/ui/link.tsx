 * select. Accepting the prop and ignoring it was worse than refusing it: three
 * sibling links honour `tone`, so `tone="inherit"` here looked like it worked
 * and silently did nothing.
 *
 * `tone?: never`, not `Omit<BaseProps, "tone">`. Omit alone only closes the
 * literal path: excess-property checking runs on object literals, so
 * `<LinkAction tone="inherit" />` is rejected, but a caller who builds props in
 * a variable or wrapper and writes `<LinkAction {...props} />` is doing an
 * ordinary assignment, where extra properties are allowed — measured, that form
 * type-checked clean and still rendered the accent, which is the exact silent
 * behaviour this change exists to end. `never` rejects both forms; the contract
 * test in `ui-v2-components.dom.test.tsx` pins the spread one.
