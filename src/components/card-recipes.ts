// The card layer.
//
// Every list-item card in the product used to write its own Tailwind string,
// and they had drifted on every axis at once. Measured across four peers that
// sit side by side in the same shell:
//
//   ToolCard        rounded-lg  --shadow-card   p-4        accent border + tint + hover lift
//   ServiceCard     rounded-xl  --shadow-inset  p-3 sm:p-4 accent border + ring/35
//   CalculatorCard  rounded-lg  --shadow-inset  p-4        accent border + --shadow-soft
//   Factsheet card  rounded-xl  --shadow-card   —          inline-style border-t-[3px]
//
// Three radii decisions, three resting elevations, four "this one is selected"
// encodings — three of them expressed as unreviewable fractional opacity on a
// token colour. Plus two byte-identical private forks of `raisedCard`, in
// `specifier-ui.tsx` and `formulation-ui.tsx`.
//
// Recipes rather than a registered component, for two reasons the repo already
// documents. COMPONENTS.md §0.4 measures 157 production importers of
// `ui-primitives.tsx` against 31 product imports across the whole 54-component
// registry, so a recipe is what surfaces actually pick up; and ledger #266 says
// adoption is demand-driven, "never a race to 54/54". A function also avoids
// re-solving element polymorphism: these cards are variously `<article>`,
// `<button>` and `<Link>`, and a component would have to take that on.
//
// A separate module rather than more of `ui-primitives.tsx`: COMPONENTS.md §0.4
// already lists that file as an over-budget module slated to split.

/**
 * Widens a row's existing link to cover the whole row, so a click or tap
 * anywhere in the row that is not another control opens the result.
 *
 * A pseudo-element on the one link already in the row, rather than a second
 * overlay anchor or a click handler on the container. Three reasons, and all
 * three are constraints rather than preferences:
 *
 * - The row stays a real link, so a tap activates it natively — no synthetic
 *   events, no `touch-action` plumbing — and long-press "open in new tab" and
 *   cmd/ctrl-click keep working. A container `onClick` breaks all of that.
 * - Assistive technology still hears one link per row, named by the result. A
 *   duplicate anchor would double the length of every screen-reader link list.
 * - Nothing is nested inside a link, so the row keeps its `<article>`/`<tr>`
 *   element and its sibling controls stay siblings. `docs/design-system/
 *   sweep-2026-08-29-structure.md` records that this repo has zero nested
 *   interactive elements and re-verifies it.
 *
 * Three things the caller must do:
 *
 * 1. The row container needs `relative` (and `group`, if the row hover-styles
 *    its children), or the stretch resolves against the wrong ancestor. Note
 *    this is `after:` rather than `before:` on purpose — several row containers
 *    already spend `before:` on a decorative accent rail, and reusing it would
 *    silently delete the rail (`forms-search-results-page.tsx` is one).
 * 2. Every other control in the row needs `relative z-10`, or it falls under
 *    the stretch layer and stops being clickable.
 * 3. Do not paint a focus ring on the pseudo-element. The `:focus-visible`
 *    rule in `globals.css` is unlayered, so it wins over any `outline-none`
 *    here, and a second ring would stack — which is exactly what the "focus is
 *    singular" assertion in `tests/ui-smoke.spec.ts` forbids. Focus stays on
 *    the link itself, at its own size.
 *
 * The pseudo-element paints nothing, so it needs no radius of its own — and a
 * `rounded-[inherit]` arbitrary value is a raw radius literal that the
 * design-system contract ratchet counts against the calling file.
