 * is ever added into `availableNow`.** A coordinator must be able to point at that number and say
 * "that is a bed I can fill this minute", and it must never have been softened by an expectation.
 *
 * The rule's mirror image, added by the bed-model rework of 2026-08-28 (Q4) and just as binding:
 * **nothing is ever SUBTRACTED from `availableNow` for a preparation note either.** A released bed
 * being made ready (cleaning, and whatever the owner's pending list eventually names) is still
 * offered and still counted, because pulling the next patient takes hours anyway — see
 * `BED_PREPARATION_NOTES`. `availableNow` is derived from the unit's own `allocatable`/`empty`
 * figures and reads no `BedRelease` field at all, which is what makes both halves of the rule
 * structural rather than remembered.

/**
 * WHICH DAY FIRST, THEN WHICH PART OF THAT DAY. Rewritten 2026-08-30; read the reason before
 * changing it back.
 *
 * The three named constants are minutes from the start of DAY ZERO. Until the demo clock moved,
 * every instant WAS a minute of day zero, so comparing a raw instant against them was correct —
 * and the comment that used to sit here defended exactly that, for a real reason restated below.
 *
 * **Once the clock ran past midnight that comparison collapsed.** An instant on day one is 1440 or
 * more, so every release on day one exceeded `EVENING_SHIFT_END_MINUTES` and came back
 * `"beyond-today"`: the whole band vocabulary reduced to one value, and "beyond today" came to
 * mean "beyond day zero". Confirmed by running it rather than inferred —
 * `tests/ward-release-band-day-boundary.test.ts` failed with `expected 'beyond-today' to be
 * 'by-midday'` for an 09:00 discharge read at 08:00 on day one.
 *
 * **The rule the old comment protected still holds and is still enforced.** A release a full day
 * after `now` must NOT wrap back into an earlier band — `now + 1440` falls at the same clock time
 * as `now` and is emphatically not "now". That is why the DAY comparison comes first and
 * short-circuits before any minute-of-day comparison is reached. Wrapping first was the danger;
 * wrapping only after the day is settled is not.
 *
 * **DB-7 HAS SINCE LANDED and this paragraph's premise is gone.** It said the horizon was
 * deliberately unchanged and that a later day was still `"beyond-today"`. The owner answered on
 * 2026-08-30: the horizon rolls a full twenty-four hours and a later day is `"tomorrow"`. The
 * morning page carries the stated notice that its figures rose because the rule changed. Kept as a
 * record rather than deleted, because the reasoning above is why the change was dangerous to make
 * carelessly, and that is still true
