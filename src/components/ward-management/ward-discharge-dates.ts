/**
 * Task 4 (Ward Board plan): the ward sets ONE expected discharge date per occupancy
 * (`Admission.expectedDischargeAt`), and this module is where everything forward-looking gets
 * derived from it. Pure functions only — no React, no state, no I/O — and no bed arithmetic of
 * its own: `derivedBedReleases` produces the `BedRelease[]` view that `capacityBreakdown`
 * (`ward-bed-availability.ts`) already knows how to bucket into today/beyond-today and
 * expected/confirmed/blocked. Re-deriving any of THAT here would be exactly the drift this
 * module exists to prevent — if a count needs computing, `capacityBreakdown` is where it belongs.
 *
 * **A `"confirmed"` release comes from `Admission.dischargeConfirmedAt` and from NOTHING ELSE
 * (owner ruling, 2026-08-29).** A discharge date is a PLAN; confirming it is a DECISION. The first
 * implementation of this module could reach only `"expected"`, because `Admission` recorded no
 * decision at all, and it declined to invent a proxy for one — "the date has arrived", "the date
 * has been set a while", "the date has never moved". That refusal was right: each of those renders
 * a ward decision that nobody made, on a screen a coordinator reads as fact, which is the same
 * class of fabricated claim as an invented statutory figure. `dischargeConfirmedAt` is the fix, and
 * it is the ONLY route to `"confirmed"` here. A date window or a move count must never become one
 * again, however reasonable it looks in review.
 *
 * A confirmed release still needs a real `expectedAt`, so an admission confirmed with no
 * `expectedDischargeAt` yields NO release rather than a release at a fabricated instant — rule 3
 * below applies to a decided discharge exactly as it applies to a planned one.
 *
 * **`waitingOn` is BLANK on every derived release (owner ruling, 2026-08-29), and blank is a
 * different fact from `"Nothing outstanding"`.** Silence means NOBODY HAS LOOKED at what is
 * holding this discharge up. `"Nothing outstanding"` means a ward looked and found nothing in the
 * way. `Admission` has no field naming an obstacle and no field recording that anybody examined
 * one, so silence is the only fact this module has — and it must say so by leaving `waitingOn`
 * null. The previous implementation defaulted every derived prediction to `"Nothing outstanding"`,
 * which collapsed those two facts into the optimistic one and put it on the board for every
 * discharge nobody had examined.
 *
 * That was a defect in the DEFAULT, never in the value. `"Nothing outstanding"` stays in
 * `BED_RELEASE_WAITING_ON` verbatim: a ward that has actually checked still needs to be able to
 * say so, and `tests/ward-discharge-dates.test.ts` pins its membership so a tidy-up cannot remove
 * it on the grounds that nothing sets it any more.

/** A role is required wherever `BedRelease` requires one (`confirmedBy`, `blockedBy`) but the

 *  blank: where a field CAN be blank, blank is the honest answer (see `waitingOn` above). */

/**
 * One admission's forward-looking release — `"confirmed"` when the ward has decided it is
 * happening, `"expected"` when it has only planned a date — or `null` when there is nothing to
 * derive.
 *
 * **Rule 3 lives here, and it is absolute: no `expectedDischargeAt` (or a non-finite one) means NO
 * release, never a release at `now` and never a release at a fallback instant.** An absent date
 * must never read as "not yet due" — the same discipline `isPastExpectedDischarge` holds a few
 * files away. A plausible-looking mistake this guards against: defaulting the missing date to
 * `now` "so the board has something to show" would make every undated admission look like it is
 * discharging THIS INSTANT, which is the opposite of what an absent plan means.
 *
 * Only a bed genuinely occupied (`bedIsOccupied`) can have a future release derived — a
 * waitlisted admission holds no bed yet, so a date recorded on one (incoherent input) still
 * yields no release rather than claiming a bed release nobody can point to.
 *
 * **The stage is read from `dischargeConfirmedAt` alone.** Set means the ward decided;
 * unset means it only planned. Nothing else on the record — not how close the date is, not how
 * many times it moved, not how long ago it was set — may ever be consulted to promote a release
 * to `"confirmed"`; see the module doc comment for why each of those looks reasonable and is a
 * fabricated decision. A blocker does NOT change the stage either: a blocked confirmed discharge
 * is still confirmed, and blocked is counted alongside it as a cross-cut (`blockedReleaseCount`).
 *
 * Exported (2026-09-25) so `ward-movements.ts` can build its own SEEDED `bedReleases` from exactly
 * this rule, rather than re-stating "expectedDischargeAt gives expected, dischargeConfirmedAt also
 * gives confirmed" a second time — see that module's own comment on its `bedReleases` export.
