/**
 * THE ARITHMETIC BEHIND THE COORDINATOR STATISTICS SCREEN — and nothing else.
 *
 * Every function here is pure: collections in, numbers out. No React, no clock, no I/O, and above
 * all **no substituted value**. This is the module behind the one screen whose entire purpose is
 * being believed, so the standing rule is narrower than "be careful":
 *
 * ⚠️ **NOTHING HERE EVER RETURNS A NUMBER IT DID NOT MEASURE.** No default, no fallback, no
 * interpolation, no "reasonable" zero standing in for an absence. An average with nothing to
 * average is `null`, never `0` — the same discipline `ward-statistics.ts` already documents at
 * length, held here for the same reason: a ward with no measured arrivals does not have an average
 * transport delay of nought minutes, it has no average at all, and the two claims are different.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A COUNT OF ZERO IS A REAL ANSWER AND IS TYPED AS ONE.** Every `number` field below is a
 * genuine count where `0` is true and correct; every `number | null` field is an average or an
 * extreme where `null` means "nothing to measure". The two are separated in the TYPE so a screen
 * cannot render one as the other by accident — which is the single most likely way this page could
 * lie, because "no ward declined" and "declines cannot be counted" look identical once they have
 * both been flattened to a dash.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NO FIGURE HERE IS COMPARED AGAINST A TARGET, A THRESHOLD OR A BENCHMARK.** There is no
 * "good", no "breach", no ranking of one ward against another, and nothing here may acquire one:
 * a target on this screen would be a number nobody agreed to, rendered where it is believed
 * hardest.

 * establish that the referral is the request that PRODUCED the bed: a referral raised about
 * somebody already in the bed matches just as well, carries just as good an instant, and dates the

 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS COMMENT DESCRIBED THE FIXTURE UNTIL 2026-09-01, AND THAT IS THE DEFECT RATHER THAN THE

 * RENDERS them rather than writing them into prose, and both stay true across the next fixture
 * change.
 *

 * act that ends it and a start and an end can never both exist on the record. There is no pair of
 * instants to subtract, rather than a pair nobody filled in. A count: `0` truly means no bed is
 * being prepared.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A PREPARING BED SHOULD BE AN ALREADY-FREE BED, NEVER AN ANTICIPATED ONE, and no caller may
 * describe it as "expected".** `expected` is a member of `BED_RELEASE_STATES` and means the
 * discharge has not happened yet; the `FLAG_BED_RELEASE` case in `ward-flow-reducer.ts` writes
 * `preparing: false` with the reason in terms — "A bed nobody has yet left is not being made ready.
 * Preparation only ever begins after `RELEASE_BED`" — and the seed's only `preparing: true` record
 * carries `state: "discharged"` (pinned in `tests/ward-statistics-derivations.test.ts`). Calling a
 * preparing bed an expected one inverts a capacity fact: it tells a coordinator the bed is not yet
 * available when it already is.
 *
 * ⚠️ **BUT NOTHING ENFORCES THAT, so no caller may state it flat either.** `SET_BED_PREPARATION`
 * carries a unit guard and a note-membership check and **no state guard**: nothing in the reducer
 * stops a future caller setting `preparing` on an `"expected"` release. It holds today because of
 * who calls it — `ward-screen.tsx` offers the control on discharged releases only — not because of
 * what the reducer allows.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NO STATE FILTER HERE, and that is a choice rather than an omission.** Filtering to
 * `"discharged"` would silently drop such a record from the count and hide that defect; the same
 * reasoning that keeps the clamp out of `pullToArrival` keeps the filter out of this. The flag is
 * the fact, and it is counted. If the invariant needs enforcing, it is enforced in the reducer, not
 * concealed in a statistic.
 *
 * ⚠️ **REDUCER CASES ARE NAMED, NEVER CITED BY LINE.** Two line numbers stood here until
 * 2026-09-01 and one of them (`ward-flow-reducer.ts:1135` for `FLAG_BED_RELEASE`, whose case is at
 * `:1075`) had already drifted onto the comment inside the case rather than the case itself. That
 * file belongs to another chat and moves without anything here failing, so a name that `tsc` and

 * and drops the qualifier in a summary line reintroduces the whole defect at exactly the point
 * most likely to be quoted, and a second spelling of one fact is how that happens without anything
 * going red.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS IS NOT "REFERRALS NOBODY WOULD TAKE", AND IT MUST NEVER BE NAMED THAT.** The model
 * holds no closure marker, no exhaustion flag and no cap-reached state on a `Movement`. What it
 * holds is a list of units currently deciding (`referredUnitIds`) and a list of units that have
 * refused (`declines`), and the only question arithmetic can answer is whether the first list is
 * empty while the second is not. That is a statement about ONE INSTANT — the instant this render
 * happened — and it is satisfied equally by a movement nobody will ever take and by a movement a
 * coordinator is about to refer onward in the next thirty seconds. `case "DECLINE"` removes the
 * unit from `referredUnitIds`, appends to `declines` and leaves the movement in
 * `destination_review`, which is a member of `REFERRABLE_MOVEMENT_STAGES` — so referring onward
 * again is not merely unblocked, it is the ordinary next act.
 *
 * `PARALLEL_REFERRAL_CAP` is what makes the difference material rather than pedantic: a movement can
 * be live at only that many wards at once, so a movement all of whose referrals have come back
 * declined has been put to AT MOST that many wards out of a network of many, and the rest have not
 * been asked.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THAT IS A CEILING AND MAY NEVER BE RESTATED AS A TYPICAL FIGURE.** Until 2026-09-01 this
 * said a movement had USUALLY been put to the cap's worth of wards — a claim about the
 * distribution, and nothing measures the distribution. `handoverSnapshot` selects on an empty `referredUnitIds` beside a non-empty
 * `declines`, which a movement with a single decline satisfies exactly as one that reached the cap
 * does. The cap bounds the figure from above and establishes nothing about the mode. The constant's
 * value was typed out beside it as well, which is a second copy of a fact `ward-model.ts` already
 * owns and goes stale silently the day the cap moves.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE CONDITION IS NOT RE-DERIVED HERE.** `handoverSnapshot` (`ward-derivations.ts`) already
 * defines it, the handover screen already renders it, and a second copy in this file would be a
 * second definition of one fact — free to drift, with nothing red while it did. This function
 * calls that derivation and counts what it classified. Its output shape is what constrains this
 * one, which is the intended direction of the dependency.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THAT REUSE COSTS SOMETHING, WHICH IS WHY `escalatedCount` IS RETURNED BESIDE IT.** The
 * shared derivation classifies escalation FIRST: a movement carrying a recorded `escalation` is
 * listed as `"escalated"` and is filtered out of the declined-by-all group whether or not it also
 * satisfies the condition. So `count` is a FLOOR, not the whole of "refused and nothing pending",
 * and an escalated movement satisfying the condition is invisible to it. Returning the escalated
 * count alongside is what keeps that subtraction on the page rather than inside this function —
 * the same reasoning that renders `incoherentCount` instead of dropping the record silently.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`escalation` IS NOT USED HERE AS A TERMINAL MARKER, and no caller may treat it as one.** It
 * is a manual, unvalidated field — `RECORD_ESCALATION` checks only that the movement is not closed
 * — so it records that somebody formed an opinion, never that the network was in fact exhausted.
 * It appears in this result only to disclose what the shared derivation removed from `count`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`now` IS TAKEN AND IS NOT PART OF THE ANSWER.** `handoverSnapshot`'s signature requires it
 * for its own other sections; the scoping this count depends on is `isOpen`, which reads `closure`
 * and `stage` and no clock, and the declined-by-all filter reads two array lengths.
 * `tests/ward-statistics-derivations.test.ts` pins that two different clocks give one answer, so
 * this paragraph cannot quietly stop being true.

 * declines that vanishes, and a reason removed from the model and left in the table is a row that
 * can never be anything but empty. A hand-written table checked by a hand-written test proves only
 * that one author agreed with themselves.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS IS `DECLINE_REASONS` (a ward refusing a MOVEMENT), NOT `REFERRAL_DECLINE_REASONS` (a
 * destination refusing a REFERRAL). THE TWO LISTS MUST NEVER BE MERGED OR SUMMED.** They are
 * different lengths, different members and different subjects, and `DECLINE_REASON_LABELS`
 * (`ward-referrals.ts`) is keyed by the REFERRAL list — so it is not a label table for these
 * members, and reaching for it here would label a value from one vocabulary using the other's map.
 *
 * ⚠️ **EVERY MEMBER GETS A ROW, INCLUDING THE ONES AT NOUGHT — and the first draft of this module
 * had it the other way round, so the reasoning is recorded rather than assumed.** A nought here is
 * ambiguous in no direction at all: the category exists, the scan ran, nobody used it. An OMITTED
 * row is ambiguous in three — the reason does not exist, or nobody used it, or this page does not
 * track it — and a reader cannot tell which. Worse, an omitted row is what a BROKEN GENERATOR also
 * produces: a mapping bug or a mistyped filter yields output identical to "nobody gave this
 * reason", and nothing goes red. A rendered nought is evidence the derivation ran over that
 * member; an absence is evidence of nothing. It also makes the generated-from-the-vocabulary claim
 * checkable by inspection — the vocabulary's member count and the row count are the same number,
 * and a reader can count them.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS DOES NOT BREAK "NULL IS NEVER ZERO", AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE OF WHY.** That
 * rule is about an AVERAGE: a ward with no discharges has no average length of stay, and rendering
 * nought would assert every discharge was instantaneous. `ward-statistics.ts` documents the
 * exemption in the repository's own words — count-based figures "are genuine counts, so `0` is a
 * true and correct answer for them when there is no data". A decline count is a genuine count.
 * That is why `count` below is `number` and not `number | null`: the type is where the two kinds of
 * figure are held apart, exactly as this module's own header requires.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE RULE IS "EVERY MEMBER OF A SMALL CLOSED VOCABULARY", NOT "EVERY EMPTY CATEGORY".**
 * Seven rows a reader can count is a table; seventy rows of which sixty-three are nought is a page
 * nobody reads, and burying the seven that happened is its own way of hiding them. A vocabulary
 * that grows past what fits on a screen needs a different answer — a stated total, the members that
 * occur, and an explicit count of the members that do not — decided then, not inherited from here.
 * `vocabularySize` is returned so a consumer can state the denominator either way, computed from
 * the list rather than typed.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE ORDER IS THE VOCABULARY'S OWN, NOT A RANKING.** Sorting by count would put the
 * most-common reason at the top, which is a league table of refusals in everything but name, and
 * this page has no ranking anywhere by a standing rule.
 *
 * ⚠️ **EVERY MOVEMENT GIVEN IS COUNTED, OPEN OR CLOSED.** A decline is a thing that happened and
 * stays true after the movement it was made against reaches a bed; filtering to open movements

/**
 * HOW MANY BLOCKED DISCHARGES EACH BLOCKER ACCOUNTS FOR, ACROSS EVERY ADMISSION THAT HAS NOT DEPARTED.
 *
 * ⚠️ **"HAS NOT DEPARTED" IS WIDER THAN "ON THE WARD", AND THIS COMMENT SAID THE NARROWER THING
 * UNTIL 2026-09-07.** The filter is `admissionStagePosition(admission) !== "ended"`, and that
 * admits three stage positions, not one: `no-bed-yet` (`waitlisted` — accepted in principle, no
 * bed given), `bed-given-not-arrived` (`pulled` — the bed is held, the person has not come) and
 * `in-the-bed` (`occupied`). Only the third is somebody physically on the ward. The seed says so
 * in its own words: the waitlist rows "hold nothing", and the pulled branch is "the bed is gone;
 * the person is not here."
 *
 * The count is right; its DESCRIPTION was wrong, and wrong in the flattering direction — an
 * inflated denominator makes the blocked share of a ward look smaller than it is.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS READS `Admission.blockReason`, A `BedReleaseBlocker | null` — NOT `Movement.blocker`.**
 * `Movement.blocker` is free prose about a referral struggling to find a placement, gated through
 * `hasActiveBlocker` in `ward-priority.ts`; a deferral commit named that function as the reason this
 * figure had not been built, and that was a wrong diagnosis — `hasActiveBlocker` never touches this
 * field and needs no repair for this figure to exist. `ward-model.ts` states the same warning from
 * the other field's own doc comment: "`Movement.blocker` — the free-prose one. NOT `BedRelease.blocker`,
 * the `BedReleaseBlocker` enum that shares the name. Nothing here applies to that field." `blockReason`
 * is a closed enum chosen from `BED_RELEASE_BLOCKERS`, so reading it needs no predicate at all — `!==
 * null` is the whole test, exactly as `readyToLeaveCannot` (`ward-statistics.ts`) already does it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`BedRelease.blocker` IS DELIBERATELY NOT READ HERE.** It is a second field carrying the same
 * vocabulary about a different record — a `BedRelease` has no `admissionId`, so there is no join back
 * to a specific admission that would let the two be combined without risking a double count of one
 * discharge. `Admission.blockReason` is the field `readyToLeaveCannot` already trusts for this exact
 * fact, and this figure trusts the same one rather than inventing a merge nobody asked for.
 *
 * ⚠️ **SCOPED TO ADMISSIONS STILL ON THE WARD, NEVER TO THE FULL HISTORY — the same scoping
 * `wardStatistics` already applies to `readyToLeaveCannot`, for the reason quoted from that file
 * rather than re-derived here:** "`blockReason` describes what is currently holding a bed up.
 * Someone who has already left is no longer being held from leaving, whatever the record still
 * says." A departed admission is excluded through `admissionStagePosition` above — the one place
 * this module reads `AdmissionState` — never through a second direct comparison against
 * `admission.state`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **ROWS ARE GENERATED FROM `BED_RELEASE_BLOCKERS`, NEVER WRITTEN OUT**, for the same reason
 * `declinesByReason` above holds to: a hand-written table checked by a hand-written test proves only
 * that one author agreed with themselves. Every member gets a row, including the ones at nought — an
 * omitted row is indistinguishable from a broken generator, and a rendered nought is evidence the scan
 * ran over that member.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`count` IS A GENUINE COUNT, TYPED `number`, NEVER `number | null`.** A blocker with no blocked
 * admissions against it is a true nought, not an absence. There is no averaging or rate anywhere in
 * this figure's natural shape and nothing here may acquire one: no instant on the record marks when a
 * block began, only `confirmedAt` — a single shared provenance field several other acts overwrite —
 * the same reasoning `bedsBeingPrepared` above documents for why no duration is recoverable from it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE ORDER IS THE VOCABULARY'S OWN, NOT A RANKING.** No figure on this page sorts a blocker to
 * the top for being common.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A BLOCKER OUTSIDE THE VOCABULARY THROWS RATHER THAN BEING DROPPED**, matching
 * `declinesByReason`'s own reasoning: `BedReleaseBlocker` makes it impossible at compile time, the
 * seed is data and `tsc` is not what most people run, so an admission carrying an unknown blocker must
 * fail loudly rather than quietly shrink a total that still looks plausible.
