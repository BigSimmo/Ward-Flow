/**
 * THE CLAIMS REGISTER — the statements the statistics and community screens make about the data
 * model, each either paired with the line of real source that makes it true, or listed in
 * `UNEVIDENCED_CLAIMS` with the reason no line can be cited for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **IT IS A SWEEP OF `REGISTERED_SURFACES`, NOT A GUARANTEE THAT NOTHING ON THEM IS UNRECORDED,
 * AND THE OPENING LINE CLAIMED OTHERWISE UNTIL 2026-09-01.** It read "EVERY statement … paired with
 * the line of real source that makes it true" — an unearned absolute in the strongest position in
 * the file, in the file whose entire subject is that an overstated guarantee is worse than an
 * absent one. Two things falsify it at once: `UNEVIDENCED_CLAIMS` below is a list of statements
 * these screens make that are deliberately NOT paired with any line, and a statement inside a
 * registered surface can be carried by neither list — a false sentence on
 * `statistics-overview-screen.tsx`, a file named in `REGISTERED_SURFACES`, was found in exactly
 * that state on the same day. Exclusion class 6 below already said so; the title line now agrees
 * with the body instead of overstating it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHY THIS EXISTS.** On 2026-09-01 seven statements these screens make about the model were
 * found FALSE. Every one passed the entire test suite. Every one was found by a human reading, or
 * by somebody asking a question — not one by a gate. `ReferralAddressing` was said to "carry no
 * unit at all" while carrying `acceptedUnitId`; "nothing marks the moment preparation started" was
 * written while `SET_BED_PREPARATION` stamps `confirmedAt`; `Admission` was said to keep five
 * instants when it keeps seven; follow-up was said to have "no field for it" while
 * `Admission.followUp` exists and is seeded. The arithmetic on these pages has been right all day.
 * The explanations have not.
 *
 * That matters more here than it would anywhere else. These pages refuse to show figures they
 * cannot support and explain why. A reader has no way to check the explanation and every reason to
 * trust it, so **a false explanation is worse than a missing figure.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE MECHANISM.** Each claim is paired with an exact substring of a REAL source file, read
 * from disk at test time by `tests/ward-statistics-claims.test.ts`. The substring must appear in
 * that named file **exactly once**. A claim whose evidence has moved, been renamed, been deleted or
 * become ambiguous goes red NAMING THE CLAIM, not the string.
 *
 * The evidence is never a copy pasted in here for safekeeping. A copy cannot go stale, which is
 * precisely what would defeat the whole mechanism: the register is a set of POINTERS, and a pointer
 * into a file that has moved on is exactly the failure worth catching.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHITESPACE IS THE ONLY THING NORMALISED.** Every run of whitespace — in the file and in the
 * citation — collapses to a single space before matching, so that Prettier re-wrapping a JSX
 * paragraph or a doc comment is not a false red. Nothing else is normalised: no case folding, no
 * punctuation stripping, no near-matching. A renamed field, a changed type, a deleted line and a
 * second copy of the same declaration all still fail.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE CLAIM IS NOT RESTATED HERE — THE REGISTER CITES THE SCREEN.** Of the two ways round,
 * this module could hold the page's sentences and have the screens render from it, or it could
 * point at where each sentence already lives. It points. The reason is that the sentences are JSX
 * with `<code>` and `<strong>` inside them, entity escapes, and in two cases a conditional branch;
 * pulling them in here would either flatten them into strings the DOM tests could no longer pin, or
 * make this a component module instead of a readable list. So `claim` below is a one-line summary
 * IN THE REGISTER'S OWN WORDS — deliberately not the rendered sentence — and `rendered` is a short
 * locator copied from the screen file, which the test asserts appears there exactly once too. The
 * locator is a fragment of the screen rather than a second copy of the claim, and being pinned
 * exactly-once it cannot drift out of agreement silently either. Both ends are checked: the screen
 * still says it, and the source still supports it.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT THIS MECHANISM CANNOT CATCH. Be specific here rather than apologetic — a guard that
 * overstates its own reach is the same defect one level up, and this project shipped exactly that
 * defect today.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 *  1. **A claim that was wrong the day it was written, and cited correspondingly wrongly.** If
 *     somebody writes "`ReferralAddressing` carries no unit" and cites the `Movement` type body as
 *     evidence, both halves agree with each other and the test is green. The register checks that
 *     evidence still says what it said; it cannot check that the claim FOLLOWS from the evidence.
 *     That inference is a reading, and only a reader does it. **The register makes a claim decay
 *     loudly. It does not make a claim true.**
 *
 *  2. **Any claim of ABSENCE.** A substring can only witness something that exists. "Nothing in the
 *     reducer stops a caller flagging a discharge that has not happened yet", "there is no role
 *     check on this route", "no instant on `Admission` marks entry to `waitlisted`" — none of these
 *     has a line to cite, because the fact is that no line is there. Adding the very field a claim
 *     denies exists therefore breaks nothing here. Those claims are listed in
 *     `UNEVIDENCED_CLAIMS` below with the reason, so the gap is countable rather than invisible;
 *     several of them are guarded by other tests, named there.
 *
 *  3. **Claims about the SEED FIXTURE — and this register no longer carries any.** A fixture is not
 *     a contract: the citation would have to be a data file, the count changes with the data, and
 *     `statistics-derivations.ts` records that this exact class of sentence has falsified itself
 *     silently four times on one paragraph. Listing such a claim in `UNEVIDENCED_CLAIMS` makes the
 *     risk countable but leaves it live on the page, so on 2026-09-01 the owner took the other
 *     route: the two that were here — one on the ED screen about how many seeded referrals carry a
 *     `triagedAt`, one on the community index about how many pages the dynamic route serves — were
 *     **removed from the prose instead of recorded as gaps**, and their entries deleted with them.
 *     The rule the pages now follow: describe what the derivation can and cannot establish, never
 *     what the seed happens to contain, and where a quantity is genuinely needed RENDER it from
 *     live state rather than typing it. A count that is rendered is fine; a count that is typed is
 *     the defect. Anything of this shape arriving here in future belongs in that rewrite, not in
 *     `UNEVIDENCED_CLAIMS`.
 *
 *  4. **Whether the claim is still ON THE PAGE.** `rendered` pins that the locator exists in the
 *     screen file — not that the sentence around it still says what `claim` summarises. Deleting a
 *     whole paragraph, locator and all, goes red. Rewriting the sentence around a surviving
 *     `data-testid` does not.
 *
 *  5. **A CITATION THAT CANNOT FAIL — this WAS the largest gap, and since 2026-09-01 it is closed
 *     by a mechanism rather than by care.** Every check here used to ask only whether the cited
 *     bytes are still present. It never asked the question that matters: **would the claim's
 *     falsity change those bytes?** An audit put all the entries below to exactly that test and
 *     TWELVE failed it — including one where THIS FILE asserted in prose that a citation was
 *     "cited whole" when it covered neither end of the body it named. Unguarded while appearing
 *     guarded is worse than unguarded, because the coverage number counts it.
 *
 *     ⚠️ **THE FIX: EVERY CLAIM SHIPS WITH ITS OWN FALSIFYING EDIT, AND THE TEST APPLIES IT.**
 *     `falsifiedBy` records a change to `sourceFile` that would make the claim FALSE.
 *     `tests/ward-statistics-claims.test.ts` applies it IN MEMORY and asserts the evidence
 *     substring is then ABSENT. Nothing is written to disk, no suite runs, no build happens — the
 *     existing check was already a substring test over file contents, so this is one string
 *     replacement and a second `includes()`, and doing it for every claim costs microseconds. That
 *     is why it is worth doing here and would not be worth doing against a real test suite.
 *
 *     What it buys is that **an unfalsifiable claim becomes impossible to register.** For a comment
 *     citation, a slice cited for an "only", or a type declaration cited for a computation, there
 *     is no edit that removes the cited bytes AND makes the claim false — and the author finds that
 *     out at registration rather than four months later.
 *
 *     ⚠️ **A CITATION CAN BE PRESENT, UNIQUE, AND RIGHT BY ACCIDENT.** The property being guarded
 *     is not "it gives the right answer today" — it is "it would stop giving the right answer if
 *     the claim stopped being true". Those come apart. A comment citation can be perfectly correct
 *     right now and the guard will still reject it, and that is the guard working, not the guard
 *     being pedantic: the comment's presence is unconnected to the fact it is standing in for, so
 *     it will go on being green after the fact changes and go red if somebody merely tidies it.
 *     The same defect exists outside this feature — `tests/route-reachability.test.ts` has been
 *     satisfied by a module's own note describing a link, with the real link mutated away.
 *
 *     ⚠️ **THE RESIDUAL, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN.** An author can record a WEAK falsifying edit:
 *     one that removes the cited bytes for a reason unrelated to the claim (retype a field to
 *     `never`, delete the line, rename it). Nothing closes that mechanically. It is much narrower
 *     than what it replaces, because it now takes deliberately writing a misleading edit rather
 *     than merely picking a convenient string — and `falsifiedBy.change` is where the author says
 *     in words what change to the world the edit stands for, so a reader can judge it. Where an
 *     edit only falsifies PART of a claim (the positive half of an "only", say), `change` says so.
 *
 *     ⚠️ **The reversal worth recording, because it inverts the obvious heuristic.** The citations
 *     that quote an ENTIRE TYPE BODY look loose and are the STRONGEST in the register:
 *     `COMMUNITY_TEAM_BODY` breaks if a field is added, removed or reordered, which is every change
 *     that would make its "and nothing else" false. Being large is not being loose — that one is
 *     large BECAUSE it pins an absence. The defect was in the short, tidy, specific-looking
 *     citation. Length was never the property that mattered; falsifiability was.
 *
 *     ⚠️ **AND THE PROSE ABOUT A CITATION IS NOT THE CITATION.** `WARD_DESTINATION_ARM` carried a
 *     doc comment saying the arm was "cited whole… only the whole arm can witness the never" while
 *     the string started at `sex:` and stopped at `secureBedNeeded:` — omitting `kind` and
 *     `involuntaryBedNeeded` and touching neither end. Nothing could have caught that except a
 *     reader or the falsifying-edit test, and the falsifying-edit test now does.
 *
 *  6. **Prose anywhere else.** This register covers the files listed in `REGISTERED_SURFACES`. A
 *     new statistics screen is not swept until somebody adds it, and nothing here notices that
 *     nobody did. The one thing that partly covers this: the test asserts every registered surface
 *     file exists, so a screen that is renamed or deleted fails rather than quietly dropping out.

     * multi-field citation stopped matching. The reducer still writes `referralId: null` when it
     * builds an admission from a movement, so the sentence on the page is untouched.
     *
     * ⚠️ **The old comment here named the wrong event.** It said `PATIENT_ARRIVED`. The admission is
     * built in **`PULL_PATIENT`** — the only `const admission: Admission = {` in the reducer, and the
     * only place one is built from a movement. (`const departed: Admission` later is a spread of an
     * existing admission, not a build.) **That error was found only because the failure message
     * forbids re-pointing without reading; a silent re-anchor would have preserved it.**
     *
     * ⚠️ **The anchor is now ONE line, and deliberately so.** `referralId: null,` occurs exactly once
     * in the reducer, so it is unambiguous — and unlike a multi-field fragment it cannot be broken by
     * inserting an unrelated field beside it. A contiguous citation spanning several fields is a
     * citation that any neighbouring change can falsify without touching the claim.
     *
     * 🔴 **RE-EVIDENCED 2026-09-17, R4 (`docs/ward-flow/plans/2026-09-16-fix-plan-referral-model.md`).**
     * `PULL_PATIENT` no longer writes `referralId: null,` unconditionally — that was the defect the
     * plan names: `admissionBelongsToTeam` (`community/community-derivations.ts`) reads this exact
     * field, so it was `false` for every runtime admission without exception, and a community
     * team's own referred patient vanished from its team page the instant a ward pulled them a bed.
     * `referralId` is now DERIVED from `resolvedReferral`, the movement's own linked referral, the
     * same "resolve, never merely store" discipline `patientId` beside it already held to. The
     * citation moves to the resolving expression itself, which still means exactly what the claim

   * the old locators at the new values would have recorded a claim the page no longer makes in
   * words.

   * The sixth said `ward-statistics.ts` has no consumer in the app. It now has one — this page —
   * so the claim is FALSE rather than relocated. Its own guard in
   * `tests/ward-statistics-sections.test.ts` was written to "go red the day one appears", and it
   * did exactly that on the commit that added the consumer. That test is inverted in the same
   * change, because an absence guard outliving its absence is a guard that can only ever be wrong.

     * `statistics-derivations.ts` now reads "has since had the clamp removed under the same ruling
     * and now returns `null`", verified by reading the merged file, not by reading either comment.
     * So the contradiction Ward Lead wrote down no longer exists, and the locator points at the
