 * WHAT A REFERRING CLINICIAN IS SHOWN ABOUT EACH DESTINATION, AT THE MOMENT OF CHOOSING.
 *
 * Spec Part 7 ("What the referrer IS shown", `docs/ward-flow-referral-destination-spec.md`), owner
 * 2026-08-30: _"add all relevant catchment and referral info for the referrer to aid the process."_
 * The catchment work was designed to help a coordinator route; it helps the CLINICIAN, while they
 * choose, which is what this module serves.
 *
 * ## The rules this file exists to keep, each of which is a decision rather than a style
 *
 * **NOTHING HERE RANKS THE PATIENT, AND NOTHING HERE SCORES AN OPTION.** Every value below is a
 * sentence or a count of beds; there is no ordinal, no percentage, no star and no weight, and the
 * option type deliberately has no field one could be put in. A rule a clinician can read is a rule
 * they can argue with; a score is not — so the reasons are written as rules ("serves this patient's
 * suburb", "has a bed free that can hold someone involuntarily") and never as a verdict.
 *
 * **ORDER IS BY CATCHMENT, THEN BY NAME**, and by nothing else — `compareOptions` below. Ordering
 * by anything derived from the person is exactly the ranking this screen must not do. Worth saying
 * plainly: with today's three labels the catchment key never actually changes the order, because
 * the only option that can carry a catchment ("Community team") already sorts first by name. It is
 * written as two keys anyway so that the rule, not today's coincidence, is what a fourth
 * destination kind would be ordered by.
 *
 * **`referralEligibility` IS CALLED IN THE WARD ARM AND NOWHERE ELSE.** It takes the ward
 * DESTINATION deliberately (see its own doc comment), which is what makes "a community team cannot
 * be asked about bed security" a compiler fact rather than a screen remembering. This module
 * branches on `kind` and calls it only under `psychiatric_ward`; there is no convenience overload
 * taking a bare referral, and adding one would delete that guarantee for every caller at once.
 *
 * **THERE IS NO `medical_ward` OPTION**, because there is no such destination — owner, 2026-08-30:
 * "just route to ED which also includes medical ward". `ward-model.ts` records the deferral and its
 * reason where the arm would be. The emergency-department option says so on screen, so a clinician
 * looking for a medical ward is told where it went rather than left to conclude it was forgotten.
 *
 * **NO FIGURE, TIMEFRAME, THRESHOLD OR DURATION FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT APPEARS HERE.** The only
 * numbers this module produces are counts of units read off the seeded network and elapsed waits
 * read off referrals that already exist.
 */

 * What the catchment sources can say about one destination, for this patient's suburb.

 * one extracted source document happens to name. `ReferralDestination`'s `teamName` is a plain
