 * distinct `*Note` classes. This is one of each, for these three screens; nothing outside them is
 * migrated here.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`tone` DRAWS A COLOURED LEFT EDGE AND NOTHING ELSE**, so a toned row with no state word is a
 * coloured stripe carrying meaning on its own — the exact defect `WardChip`'s own word requirement
 * refuses one level down. An UNTONED row with no states is fine: it makes no claim, and a test
 * asserts that case too, so this guard cannot be satisfied by banning both.
 *
 * The edge is on the LEFT rather than across the top. A left edge survives a row wrapping onto four
 * lines, and it does not compete with the panel heading directly above it.
