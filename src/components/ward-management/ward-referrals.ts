 *
 *   accepted — a destination accepted, AND no non-community destination is still `"queued"` (see
 *              RB5 below for why a still-open ward or ED arm holds this back even when a community
 *              arm has already accepted). FD-22 cancels every other COMPETING (non-community)
 *              destination the moment a non-community one accepts, so there is never a second bed
 *              acceptance.
 *   declined — EVERY destination declined. One ward saying no is not a declined referral (FD-24);
 *              that is the case this function exists to get right.
 *   queued   — anything else, including a referral with one decline and two still waiting, and a
 *              referral whose only accepted arm is a community team while a ward or ED arm is
 *              still waiting to answer.
 *
 * `cancelled` is deliberately not a referral state. A destination is cancelled by somebody else's
 * acceptance; the referral that happened to is accepted, which is the more useful thing to say.
 *
 * ⚠️ **RB5 (item 16): A COMMUNITY ACCEPTANCE IS NEVER A BED ACCEPTANCE WHILE A BED QUESTION IS
 * STILL OPEN.** A community team may now accept its own arm (`ACCEPT_REFERRAL` permits `community`)
 * — but "community referral means a patient is about to be discharged" (owner ruling 2026-09-01,
 * the same one that already exempts a community arm from FD-22 cancellation, in the reducer's
 * `ACCEPT_REFERRAL` case). If accepting it also flipped `referralState` to `"accepted"` while a
 * ward or ED destination is still `"queued"`, every guard that reads this function to mean "a bed
 * is settled" — `RECORD_REFERRER_WITHDRAWAL`'s "already accepted, so it cannot be withdrawn"
 * refusal among them — would wrongly lock out a ward or ED that has not answered yet, over a
 * follow-up commitment that was never competing with them.
 *
 * **But a non-community destination that has already been decided (declined, or cancelled by an
 * earlier acceptance) is not "still open", and must not hold a community acceptance back either** —
 * that is the case a ward already having declined, with the community team then accepting, decides.
 * So the test is narrower than "any non-community destination exists": it is "a non-community
 * destination is still QUEUED, genuinely awaiting an answer". Once none is, a destination that HAS
 * accepted — community included — is the referral's outcome, exactly as it always was.

 * SCREEN CARRYING AN EXPLICIT OWNER RULING.** `ward-referral-visibility.ts` records it: because the
 * helper returns a sex only when a ward arm exists, an ED rendering those facts already learns THAT
 * a ward was asked — one bit, in shipped code, and *"the owner was told that when he was asked, and
 * the ruling records it… No fix is scheduled for it and none should be opened."*

 * **Emitting "not a ward referral" from the shared helper would not add a bit — it would turn a bit
 * a careful reader could INFER into a sentence every reader is TOLD.** That is a change in what a
 * department is disclosed, on the one surface whose disclosure the owner was consulted about, made
 * as a side effect of a copy ruling about a phone card. So the board gets its own function and the

   * ⚠️ PLACEHOLDER WORDING. THE OWNER HAS NOT CHOSEN THIS SENTENCE.
   *
   * He chose the SHAPE — a catch-all a ward picks deliberately, never free text — when asked what
   * a ward should do when its real reason is not on the list. The example wording he was shown was
   * illustrative, so no sentence here is his, and this one is mine.
   *
   * ⚠️ TWO PROPERTIES, BOTH LEARNED BY GETTING IT WRONG, AND BOTH MUST SURVIVE ANY REWORDING.
   *
   * ⚠️ 1. IT ASSERTS NO PAST ACT. The first draft was "Another clinical reason — discussed with
   * the referrer". That second half does real work — it stops a catch-all becoming the lazy
   * default that hollows out the other six within a month — but it puts into the record a claim
   * that A CONVERSATION HAPPENED, and nothing here knows whether it did. A ward picking this
   * because it is the only option left would file a discussion it never had, and in any later
   * review of a person's care that record would read as evidence the conversation took place.
   * Same fabricated-record defect as the pre-selected "no suitable bed" this list was just fixed
   * for — about a clinical interaction rather than a bed. A next step cannot be false at the
   * moment it is recorded; a past act can.
   *
   * ⚠️ 2. IT INSTRUCTS NOBODY IN PARTICULAR, because this label has THREE readers and my own
   * second draft failed on that. "Another reason — see the coordinator" renders on
   * `referral-board.tsx:65` — THE COORDINATOR'S OWN BOARD — where it tells a coordinator to go and
   * see themselves. It also renders at `ed-screen.tsx:1175` and `referral-match.tsx:458`. A
   * sentence written for one reader and displayed to another is the same failure as a refusal
   * telling a nurse to record a reason on a screen with no control to record one.
   *
   * So it describes a property of the DECLINE rather than an obligation on a READER — the same
   * move that turned an engine refusal from an instruction into a state, for the same reason.
   * Drafted by Ward Verifier after it withdrew its own first version; the third render site is
   * mine, found when I checked its measurement rather than accepting it.

 * means a service looked at this referral and said no; `cancelled` means nobody looked at all — a

 *
 * Three properties, each pinned by a test in `tests/ward-travel-grouping.test.ts`, because the
 * defining hazard of this phase is grouping quietly becoming ranking and that never arrives as a
 * decision — it arrives as a small helpful sort inside a group, or a group promoted to the top
 * because it is the useful one:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing is lost.** Every candidate lands in exactly one group. The key expression below is
 *     total over `TRAVEL_BAND_GROUP_ORDER` by construction — `unitTravelBand` returns
 *     `TravelBand | undefined`, and `undefined` maps to `"not_recorded"` — so there is no branch a
 *     candidate can fall out of and no bucket to be forgotten. A bed whose band the fixture does
 *     not record is SHOWN as unrecorded, never dropped and never guessed at.
 *  2. **Nothing is reordered inside a group.** `filter` preserves the caller's order, which is the
 *     site table's own order (`allUnits()` in `ward-sites.ts`), the same fixed order the morning
 *     page and the match view already use. There is no comparator here to tune.
 *  3. **Always exactly five groups, empty ones included.** An omitted group is worse than an empty
 *     one: "there is nothing within an hour" is the answer a coordinator came for, and a group
 *     that vanishes when it is empty cannot give it.
 *
 * Distance NEVER gates. Grouping is all this does — `ward-eligibility.ts` knows nothing about a
 * band and has no `travel_time` gate, so a bed three hours away that accepts this referral still
 * says so and still carries its Accept control.
 *
 * The band is looked up per call and never stored — not here, not on a `Referral`, not in a cache.
 * A stored band would outlive the day `ward-travel-bands.ts`'s placeholder values are replaced
 * with checked ones, which is precisely what must not happen.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT the signature cannot enforce, recorded rather than papered over: this groups the list
 * it is GIVEN, so "nothing is lost" is a property relative to its own input and not a guarantee
 * that every unit in the network reached it. `referralCandidates` above never truncates, and
 * `tests/ward-travel-grouping.test.ts` asserts separately that the grouped total equals the full
 * unit count — that second test, not this function, is what stops a later screen quietly handing

 * surfaces will show band groups — the match view, and later the network diagram — and "how many

 * "accepts" means is how this project ended up with three screens holding their own copy of one
 * label, two of which disagreed.
 *
 * **Why it takes the GROUP and not `(referral, units, now)`.** This is the structural guarantee,
 * not a convention: taking the group means the only thing it can count is the very
 * `ReferralCandidate` objects the rows beneath the heading render, reading the `verdict` already
 * computed for each. It is not possible to write a heading that disagrees with its own rows,
 * because there is no second verdict for it to disagree with. A signature taking `now` would
 * permit exactly that divergence — `referralEligibility`'s `capacity_freshness` gate is
 * time-dependent, so a heading recomputed even a moment after the rows could legitimately report a
 * different number for the same beds, and nothing would look wrong in either place.

 * **It counts what is present, never what is missing.** Two positive facts about the beds in this

 * being present and populated, never by a number here. `accepting` is a subset of `units` and is

 * `arrivedAt` stamp added to `Referral`, and it had NO EXIT: a referral never stops being
 * accepted, so somebody discharged weeks ago stayed on this ledger forever with their elapsed
 * time still climbing. `Admission` (`ward-admissions.ts`) is the one record of a person occupying
 * a bed and it closes — `state: "departed"` and `leftAt` — which is why the referral field and its
 * `REFERRAL_ARRIVED` event were removed rather than kept alongside. One fact, one record.
 *
 * **The two numbers do not share a denominator.** `entries.length` counts people out of area;
 * `notBanded` counts admissions the fixture records no band for. Neither is a part of the other and
 * neither is a part of any whole — this returns exactly those two keys and no total, precisely so
 * that no screen can read a proportion out of it. A ratio of the two would be a figure this phase
 * has not been asked to author and that nobody has checked.
 *
 * **`notBanded` will normally be the far larger number, and that is the honest output of this
 * rule rather than a defect.** `SYNTHETIC_TRAVEL_BANDS` records only some home regions, and only
 * some sites within those, so most beds cannot be classified at all — measured against the
 * admission seed as it stood on 2026-08-29, the unclassified count outnumbered the out-of-area
 * count by roughly twelve to one. At that ratio ANY construction implying the second number is a
 * shortfall, a remainder or an incompleteness of the first would be actively misleading, which is
 * why the guard here is structural rather than advisory: this function returns two keys, no total,
 * no percentage and no denominator, and `tests/ward-travel-grouping.test.ts` asserts that key set
 * exactly. Two facts, side by side, neither one a part of the other.
 *
 * What each case does, and why:
 *
 *  - **Not holding a bed** → in neither number, whatever their band and however long they were
 *    there. SOMEBODY WHO HAS LEFT IS NOT IN A BED FAR FROM HOME. This is the first check in the
 *    loop and it is deliberately its own condition rather than folded into the arrival test: a
 *    departed admission still carries the `arrivedAt` it arrived on, so nothing else in this
 *    function would exclude it.
 *
 *    **It is an ALLOWLIST — `bedIsOccupied`, the record's own predicate — and never a
 *    `state !== "departed"` denylist.** Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters. First, a
 *    waitlisted admission carrying an arrival time is incoherent data, and a denylist counts it as
 *    somebody in a bed far from home. Second, and structurally: a fifth `AdmissionState` added
 *    later falls through a denylist as OCCUPIED BY DEFAULT. This ledger is read as fact by a
 *    coordinator, so an unrecognised state must be excluded rather than counted — the failure
 *    direction has to be conservative, and only an allowlist makes it so. Reusing the record's own
 *    predicate rather than restating the states here also means a state added to
 *    `ward-admissions.ts` is classified in ONE place. `tests/ward-travel-grouping.test.ts` pins
 *    both the departure and the waitlisted-with-an-arrival case directly.
 *  - **Arrived, still here, band is a member of `OUT_OF_AREA_BANDS`** → an entry. The clock runs
 *    from `arrivedAt`, NEVER from `pulledAt`: the bed has been gone since the pull, but this
 *    ledger measures how long somebody has been AWAY FROM HOME, which starts when they get there.
 *    Reading `pulledAt` would overstate every entry by the transport delay, in the same direction
 *    every time. The pull-to-arrival gap is a real and separate figure; nothing here surfaces it.
 *  - **Arrived, still here, band not recorded** → `notBanded`, never an entry. An unknown band must
 *    never become a figure, and a count that quietly excluded what it could not classify would be
 *    quoted as complete. The gap is reported as a gap — the same rule `travelBand` itself follows
 *    in returning `undefined` rather than falling back to a band.
 *  - **Arrived, still here, band recorded and in area** → in neither number. Present and correctly
 *    classified; there is nothing to report.
 *  - **Holding a bed but not yet arrived** → in neither number, and NOT reported as missing
 *    anything. A pulled bed is one given away to somebody still on their way, so as far as this
 *    prototype knows nobody is in it yet, and saying more would invent the arrival. A non-finite
 *    `arrivedAt` is treated the same way rather than yielding a `NaN` elapsed time. (A waitlisted
 *    admission never reaches this check — it holds no bed, so the allowlist above excludes it
 *    whether or not it carries an arrival.)
 *  - **`unitId` resolves to no unit** → skipped entirely, never banded against a guessed site. It
 *    is not counted as unbanded either: nothing was looked up, so nothing failed to be found.
 *
 * Order is the order `admissions` arrived in, and there is no comparator here at all. This is a
 * ledger of people, not a queue, and nothing about it ranks, prioritises or shortlists anyone.
 *
 * `units` is a parameter rather than a call to `allUnits()` so this derivation stays pure over its
 * inputs and testable against a fixture — the same reason `referralCandidates` above takes one.
 *
 * The band is looked up through `ward-distance.ts` from the admission's own `homeRegion` and the
 * accepting unit's site, exactly as `unitTravelBand` does it for a referral. No band is stored on
 * an `Admission`, and none is stored here.
