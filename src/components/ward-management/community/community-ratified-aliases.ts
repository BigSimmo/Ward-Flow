/**
 * NAMES A PERSON HAS RULED ARE ONE SERVICE — HELD DELIBERATELY APART FROM THE SIMILARITY MACHINERY.
 *
 * 🔴 **`community-vocabulary.ts` REPORTS THAT TWO NAMES ARE CLOSE AND NEVER THAT THEY ARE THE SAME
 * SERVICE, AND THAT REMAINS TRUE.** Its header says so and the distinction is the whole safety of
 * it: *"these two strings differ by one edit"* is a property of the strings, computable and
 * checkable by anybody; *"these two are one team"* is a clinical claim about a real service. This
 * file is where the second kind lives, and it is a **table a person signed**, not a rule a machine
 * derived.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE RULING COULD NOT HAVE BEEN REACHED BY LOOSENING A KEY, AND TRYING WOULD HAVE BEEN
 * DANGEROUS.** `ICC` → `Inner City Clinic` is not a string property. No edit distance reaches it —
 * they share three letters and differ in length by fourteen — no suffix fold produces it, and no
 * word-order key touches it. **Any rule loose enough to catch it would also merge `Alma Street
 * (Cockburn)` with `Alma Street (Melville)`, which are two sites and not two spellings.** A key
 * that could derive this ruling is a key that would invent others.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE SOURCE DOCUMENT KNEW, AND THE MODULE DELIBERATELY DECLINED TO ACT ON IT WITHOUT A
 * HUMAN.** `docs/ward-flow-catchment-data.md` identifies `ICC` as `Inner City Clinic` abbreviated,
 * and then rules (§6.5) that the raw clinic string is KEPT so the source stays auditable, with any
 * normalisation belonging in **a separate mapping**. This file is that separate mapping, arriving
 * at last. **Record it as the mechanism working as designed, not as a gap being closed:** the
 * document identified it, the code refused to merge on its own authority, and a person decided.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NO CATCHMENT ROW IS REWRITTEN AND NO RAW STRING IS TOUCHED.** §6.5 still stands, and a
 * referral already typed under any member spelling stays findable under that spelling.
 *
 * 🔴 **AN ENTRY IS A GROUP, NOT A PAIR, AND THAT SHAPE IS THE RULING'S OWN SAFETY.** The first
 * version of this table held `{ spelling, service }` — one pair — because the first question put to
 * the owner was the narrow one. **Expressing a four-way ruling as pairs would need six rows, and
 * any reader completing the sixth from the other five would be doing transitive inference: exactly
 * the back door this file exists to close.** One decision, one row, every member named on it.
 *
 * **Four properties this table must keep, each with a guard in
 * `tests/ward-community-ratified-aliases.test.ts`:**
 *
 *  1. **Every member of every entry is a name the picker actually offers.** A member naming a
 *     spelling that is not in the vocabulary is a rule with no subject — it would read as ratified
 *     and do nothing, which is worse than an absent row.
 *  2. **It is enumerable and reviewable — one table a clinician reads in ten seconds, never a rule
 *     they must simulate.** A second ratified case is a visible second ROW. **Widening a pattern to
 *     absorb a new case is the failure this shape exists to prevent.**
 *  3. **It is not reachable from the near-duplicate relation.** `communityNameCollisions()` must not
 *     import this file, or the two kinds of claim silently become one on the page and the reader
 *     loses the ability to tell "a person decided" from "these strings look alike".
 *  4. **The figures the decider was shown must still be the figures the data yields.** See
 *     `shownCounts`.
 */

/**
 * One ratified decision. `members` are the spellings a person ruled are one service; every one must
 * be a selectable name.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`decidedBy`, `decidedOn`, `question` and `shownCounts` are not decoration.** A merge of two
 * clinical lists with no attribution is indistinguishable from one a machine guessed, and **what was
 * ASKED determines what the answer licenses.** This ruling was very nearly recorded at half its
 * width: the owner's first answer covered `ICC` and `Inner City Clinic` only, and because the
 * similarity relation already groups `Inner City` with `Inner City Clinic`, sixteen further suburbs
 * would have ridden in on an inference he had never been asked to make. He was then shown all four
 * spellings with their counts and ruled on all four. **The narrow question and the wide one have
 * different answers, and only the recorded question can tell them apart afterwards.**

   * ═══ THE `Midland` / `Midalnd` ROW WAS HERE, AND IT IS GONE BECAUSE THE DATA WAS FIXED
   * INSTEAD — 2026-09-06, authorised by Ward Lead. ═══
   *
   * The row recorded an agent-decided ruling that the two spellings were one service: `Midland`
   * routed 68 suburbs, `Midalnd` routed 2 (Red Hill and Sawyers Valley), `Midalnd` is `Midland`
   * with two letters transposed and names no place in Western Australia, and both its suburbs
   * adjoin suburbs already routing to `Midland` — Red Hill beside Herne Hill and Baskerville,
   * Sawyers Valley beside Mundaring and Chidlow.
   *
   * ⚠️ **AN ALIAS WAS THE WRONG INSTRUMENT FOR IT, AND THIS IS THE DISTINCTION WORTH KEEPING.**
   * Every other row here records two REAL spellings of a service that genuinely exists, where
   * merging them is a judgement about the service. `Midalnd` was a typing error routing referrals
   * to **a team that does not exist** — strictly worse than any real destination — so the repair
   * was to the two catchment rows themselves (`ward-catchment.ts`), not to a layer that teaches
   * the software to read the typo.
   *
   * **A ratified alias makes a wrong name keep working. Correcting the data makes it stop
   * existing.** Where both are available, the second is the smaller surface.
   *
   * ⚠️ **AND THE GUARD BELOW IS WHAT FORCED THE CHOICE TO BE MADE OUT LOUD.** On correcting the
   * two rows, `ratifiedAliasCountsStillHold` went red with *"Midland: shown 68, now 70; Midalnd:
   * shown 2, now 0"* and its own message — *"put it back to them rather than updating these
   * numbers to match"*. Updating `shownCounts` to 70/0 would have been one keystroke, would have
   * gone green, and would have left a signed ruling about a name with no suburbs behind it.

   *
   * ⚠️ **A FIFTH SPELLING EXISTS AND IS NOT LISTED, DELIBERATELY.** `Mead centre (Armadale)` —
   * lowercase `c`, one suburb, Mt Nasura — is already folded into `Mead Centre (Armadale)` by
   * `communityTeamKey()`'s case handling, so the picker never offers it and listing it here would
