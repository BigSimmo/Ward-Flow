/**
 * 🔴 **THIS COMPONENT IS UNREACHABLE, AND ITS TESTS WERE RETIRED ON 2026-09-06 — NOT LOST.**
 *
 * reached only from community-home, itself unreachable. Owner ruling 2026-09-06: the eleven replaced ward
 * screens are finished with. The tests that covered this file (`ward-community-teams-table.dom.test.tsx`)
 * are `describe.skip`, and what each case asserted is written out in
 * `docs/ward-flow/retired-coverage-record-2026-09-06.md`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE MARKER EXISTS BECAUSE A COMPONENT WITH NO TESTS AND NO EXPLANATION READS AS AN
 * OVERSIGHT, AND THE NEXT PERSON WRITES NEW ONES.** They would pass, and they would cover
 * nothing a coordinator can open.
 *
 * **The component was deliberately NOT deleted.** Removing an exported symbol on a "nothing
 * imports it" basis is forbidden here (`docs/agents/dead-code-deletion.md`), and three defects
 * found that day were held in place BY unreachability — **an unreachable wrong screen is a fix,
 * not a delete.** If a route ever points here again, `tests/ward-component-reachability.test.ts`
 * goes red and names the declaration to remove; restore the cover from the record then.

 * distinct follow-up clinic `S2015_CATCHMENT_ROWS` names, which is **65** today (confirmed against
 * `communityTeamOptions()`'s own count, the same number `tests/ward-community-team-count.test.ts`
 * derives independently), not 16. The prototype's 16 is a curated metro/south-west subset with no
 * documented selection rule anywhere in `docs/ward-flow-catchment-data.md` — dropping the other 49
 * (mostly WACHS regional teams: Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Narrogin, Broome and the rest) to match it
 * would be inventing an editorial decision this repository has never made. So every team the source
 * table names is counted and listed, and the real, current count is what renders — 65, not 16.
