/**
 * 🔴 **THIS COMPONENT IS UNREACHABLE, AND ITS TESTS WERE RETIRED ON 2026-09-06 — NOT LOST.**
 *
 * /community renders CommunityIndex instead. Owner ruling 2026-09-06: the eleven replaced ward
 * screens are finished with. The tests that covered this file (`ward-community-scope.dom.test.tsx`)
 * are `describe.skip`, and what each case asserted is written out in
 * `docs/ward-flow/retired-coverage-record-2026-09-06.md`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE MARKER EXISTS BECAUSE A COMPONENT WITH NO TESTS AND NO EXPLANATION READS AS AN
 * OVERSIGHT, AND THE NEXT PERSON WRITES NEW ONES.** They would pass, and they would cover
 * nothing a coordinator can open.
 *
 * **The component was deliberately NOT deleted.** Removing an exported symbol on a "nothing
 * imports it" basis is forbidden here (`docs/agents/dead-code-deletion.md`), and three defects
 * found that day were held in place BY unreachability — **an unreachable wrong screen is a fix,
 * not a delete.** If a route ever points here again, `tests/ward-component-reachability.test.ts`
 * goes red and names the declaration to remove; restore the cover from the record then.

 * THE COORDINATOR'S OWN VIEW: the all-teams overview, and drilling into one team.
 *
 * Coordinator-only, both scopes. `CommunityScopedReferral` -- the restricted projection a
 * community team's own hub must read instead -- is deliberately never imported here. FD-23 (owner
 * ruling 2026-08-30, extended to community 2026-09-04) says the coordinator may see everything, and
 * that covers BOTH scopes on this screen: the all-teams aggregate and a drill-down into one team are
 * still the coordinator looking, never the team itself. `community-team-hub.tsx` is the separate
 * component for the team's own, restricted view -- see its own doc comment and the build plan's
 * Task 3b for why the two must never share a component or a data type even though a drill-down and
 * that team's own hub can render the same team at the same moment.
 *
 * Every number below is derived from live ward-flow state via `coordinatorScopedReferrals` -- none
 * is a literal. The suburb counts come from `ward-catchment.ts` through `community-teams-table.tsx`,
 * which is real repository data; see that file's doc comment on why the real team count (65 today)
 * is used rather than the design prototype's invented "16".
