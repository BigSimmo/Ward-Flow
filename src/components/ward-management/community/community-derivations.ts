/**
 * THE COMMUNITY HUB'S DERIVATIONS — who a community team can see, and, more importantly, who it
 * cannot.
 *
 * The design spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-ward-flow-community-hub-design.md`) asks for
 * four lists. **Three of them are buildable from what the model holds and one is not**, and this
 * module's job is to make that difference structural rather than a note somebody has to read: the
 * unbuildable list has no function here at all, so no screen can accidentally render a plausible
 * approximation of it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN A PERSON AND A TEAM IS `admissionBelongsToTeam` AND NOTHING ELSE.**
 * One exported function, called by every list below, so the rule lives in one place and every list
 * moves together. A screen comparing anything inline would be a second home for the same rule.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THAT RULE CHANGED, AND THE CHANGE IS THE POINT OF THIS MODULE.** This hub was first written
 * against `admission.homeRegion === team.region`, and said so honestly: it recorded that the
 * owner's ruling on whether association is home region or an explicit team was OPEN, and that
 * region was the only thing the model could then express. The owner settled it on 2026-08-31 —
 * association comes from **a team named on the referral**, and home region is a geographic guess —
 * and `ReferralDestination`'s `community_team` arm now carries `teamName`, so the settled rule is
 * expressible for the first time. Region is gone from this module entirely, and it must not come
 * back: where a person lives is not who follows them up.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE TEAMS ARE NOW THE CATCHMENT TABLE'S CLINICS, WHICH IS WHAT REFERRALS ACTUALLY NAME.**
 * The first version recorded that joining the catchment table to `COMMUNITY_TEAMS` would invent an
 * administrative fact, and it was right — but the join it refused is no longer needed. Intake
 * offers `communityTeamOptions()`, the clinics the S2015 table names, and stores the chosen one on
 * the referral; this hub reads that same vocabulary back. Nothing is mapped onto anything.
 * `COMMUNITY_TEAMS` in `ward-teams.ts` is region-keyed and is deliberately NOT read here — using it
 * would reintroduce region-derived membership under a different name.
 */

/**
 * A team page's identity: the team's name as referrals record it, and a URL-safe id.
 *
 * `id` is DERIVED from the name rather than authored beside it. A hand-written slug is a second
 * home for the name — it can disagree with the vocabulary, and the disagreement shows up as a 404
 * on one team's page while every test that iterates the list stays green.
 *
 * There is no `region` field, and its absence is enforcement rather than tidying: a screen cannot

 * `communityTeamById` resolves by recomputing this over the real list rather than by parsing the
 * slug back, so a name that would not round-trip cannot silently resolve to the wrong team; it

/**
 * ⚠️ **THE COHORT THIS HUB CANNOT SEE, AND THE REASON THE SCREEN MUST STATE ITS SIZE.**

 * `PULL_PATIENT` — and every admission whose referral asked only for a bed or an emergency department
 * appears on **no team's page, in any of the lists above**, and its absence is invisible by
 * construction: every list simply does not contain it, and every list looks exactly as it would if
 * that person did not exist.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS COHORT IS THE MAJORITY, AND SAYING SO IS THE WHOLE POINT.** Under the previous region
 * rule this number was 0 on the opening fixture, and the screen could fairly say "nobody is missing
 * yet". Under the owner's rule it is most of the ward, because naming a community team is something
 * a referrer does rarely and deliberately. A team's page is therefore NOT a picture of everybody in
 * that area — it is a picture of everybody this prototype can MATCH to that team, which is a smaller
 * and far better-defined claim, and the screen must make that claim rather than the larger one.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND IT IS NOT COMPLETE IN THE UNCONDITIONAL SENSE THIS PARAGRAPH AND THE SCREEN BOTH CLAIMED
 * UNTIL 2026-09-01.** `admissionBelongsToTeam` needs the referral to be
 * FOUND: `referrals.find(...)` returning `undefined` — a `referralId` that resolves to nothing in
 * the list this hub was handed — excludes that admission from every team's page just as surely as
 * having no referral at all. Completeness is therefore conditional on the join succeeding, and the
 * unresolved are not lost: they land in this function's own result, which is the figure the screen
 * states at the top of the page.
 *
 * Whole-system rather than per-team, because there is nothing to attribute: the missing fact IS the

 *
 * Repaired 2026-09-10 at a6e5208b85 - "seeded referralId links what is true and nulls the rest,
 * invents nothing". ⚠️ The manufacturing by string substitution is GONE, not reduced.
 *
 * ✅ THE HISTORY ABOVE IS ACCURATE AS HISTORY and is why this type exists. What has changed
 * is the present tense: the join now resolves for ten admissions and two team pages are
 * populated.
 * 🔴 EVERYTHING BELOW THIS BLOCK STILL STANDS AND IS MORE RELEVANT NOW, NOT LESS - in
 * particular that A NULL `referralId` IS NOT A BROKEN JOIN. 257 of 267 admissions carry an
 * honest null; the broken case is an id that IS set and resolves to nothing, and there are none.
 * CANNOT RESOLVE.** "Nobody referred to this team is currently in a bed" reads as a fact about the
 * service. It was, for essentially every one of the teams, a fact about a broken link:
 * `admissionBelongsToTeam` needs `Admission.referralId` to FIND a referral, the only writer of that
 * field in the reducer sets it to `null` (`ward-flow-reducer.ts`, inside `PULL_PATIENT`), and the
 * seed manufactures the rest by `AD-###` -> `RF-###` substitution against thirteen real referrals.
 * Exactly one admission joins for real. **So three of the four lists on a team page could never
 * become non-empty, and each said so in the words of a measurement.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS IS RULING E2 ONE LEVEL UP, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS A DERIVATION RATHER THAN A SENTENCE.**
 * E2 says a `number | null` measure renders as a stated absence in words, never `0` and never a
 * dash, because "no ward declined" and "declines cannot be counted" look identical once both are
 * dashes. **A list has the same two meanings and the same collapse:** "nobody is in a bed" and "we
 * cannot tell who is in a bed" must not read alike either.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND IT IS COMPUTED PER TEAM RATHER THAN WRITTEN DOWN, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT SURVIVES THE
 * FIX.** A hardcoded "this cannot be computed" is true today and becomes a FALSE GAP the day
 * somebody writes the link — the exact mirror of today's false answer, and nothing would announce
 * it. Computed, the sentence disappears on its own. Inner City Clinic, whose one member joins for
 * real, still shows that member today.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A NULL `referralId` IS NOT A BROKEN JOIN AND MUST NOT BE COUNTED AS ONE.** Somebody admitted
 * with no referral at all is a person the model can describe: they were never referred anywhere, so
 * no team page is missing them and the existing unattributable figure already covers them. **The
 * broken case is a `referralId` that IS set and resolves to nothing** — a record that claims a link
 * it does not have. Conflating the two would inflate the gap with people who are not in it.
