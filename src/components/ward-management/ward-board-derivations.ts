/**
 * The figures at the top of one ward's board.
 *
 * The board leads with ONE number — the Ready beds, `min(allocatable, empty)` — and immediately
 * under it ONE sentence naming what stops that number being true. ⚠️ This paragraph called it
 * "beds you can fill today" until 2026-09-06; that phrasing was retired by owner ruling R-B-09 on
 * 2026-09-04 (one word for one number) and the header itself was renamed then. The comment was
 * missed because the rename followed `CAPACITY_FIGURE_LABELS`, and prose reads no constant. On a real psychiatric ward the commonest
 * reason a bed is not a bed is the sex mix, and the second is having nobody free to watch someone
 * one-to-one, so those are the two things the sentence names.
 *
 * Pure functions only: no React, no state, no I/O, and no wall-clock read — `now` always arrives
 * as a parameter, the same discipline every other module in this feature holds to.
 *
 * Three rules govern this file, each written out at the function it governs:
 *
 *   1. **Every bed dimension is "does this bed ACCEPT this person", never an equality.** This is
 *      the longest comment in the file, on `bedAcceptsSex` below, because it is the single most
 *      likely way this module ships a serious bug.
 *   2. **The available figure is READ, never re-derived.** It comes out of `capacityBreakdown`
 *      (`ward-bed-availability.ts`) and nothing here does bed arithmetic of its own. A second
 *      copy of that sum is how two screens come to disagree about the one number a coordinator
 *      acts on.
 *   3. **One function decides "accepts", and the sentence is built FROM it.** `constraintSentence`
 *      takes every number it prints out of `acceptingBedCounts`' return value. It never re-counts
 *      in parallel, however obviously the parallel version would agree today.

/**
 * How far ahead the board looks for people heading home, in whole days.

 * reads the gender recorded AT REFERRAL rather than sex — see `genderDesignationResult`
 * (`ward-eligibility.ts`). `bedAcceptsSex` below still asks a genuinely sex-shaped question ("how
 * many beds accept a man") for the board headline, so its probe now supplies BOTH `sex` (required
 * on the arm) and `gender` (the same two-value figure, read by this gate): a `Female`/`Male`
 * probe gender answers the identical accepts-question `sexDesignationAccepts` always has, because
 * `genderDesignationResult` applies the same equality rule once `gender` is present.
 */

/**
 * Whether a free bed on this unit may hold a person of `sex`.
 *
 * **THIS IS AN ACCEPTS-RULE AND MUST NEVER BECOME AN EQUALITY.** `Unit.sexDesignation` is
 * `"Undesignated" | "Female only" | "Male only"`, and `"Undesignated"` — the normal case and the
 * clear majority of the seeded network — accepts a person of EITHER sex. Writing
 * `unit.sexDesignation === sex` looks entirely reasonable in review: two fields, both about sex,
 * compared. It is wrong, and it is wrong silently, because it excludes every undesignated bed —
 * most of the network — while still returning `true` for the handful of designated ones, so a
 * test that merely searched for "a bed that accepts a man" would still find one and pass. The
 * same shape applies to `Unit.authorised`: an authorised bed accepts both voluntary and
 * involuntary admissions, so it is a CAPABILITY the bed has, never a value to match against.
 *
 * The rule itself is deliberately NOT written here. `ward-eligibility.ts` already decides
 * "does this bed accept this person" for every dimension, and its `gender_designation` gate
 * (renamed from `sex_designation`, T10) is that decision for this one — given a probe `gender`
 * equal to `sex`, per that gate's own doc comment. Two components each deciding what "accepts"
 * means is how this project ended up with three screens holding one label and two of them
 * disagreeing — so this function asks the existing verdict and reads its answer, rather than
 * restating the rule in a second place that would then have to be kept in step by hand.
 *
 * The unit handed to the verdict carries `sexMix` DERIVED from the people actually in the beds
 * (`derivedSexMix`), never the hand-maintained count on `Unit`. Only the `gender_designation` gate
 * is read today and that gate does not look at `sexMix` at all — but feeding the verdict the
 * derived truth means that widening which gates are read later cannot silently reintroduce a
 * stale hand-maintained number, which is exactly the failure this whole task exists to remove.
 *
 * Only the gates whose answer DEPENDS ON THE PERSON'S SEX are read. `sex_mix` is deliberately not
 * one of them: it asks whether the ward would place a lone person of a sex given how many beds
 * are free, which is a judgement about the ward's composition rather than a property of the bed,
 * and folding it in would make "how many beds accept a man" depend on the free-bed total through
 * a threshold — a count that changes when an unrelated bed frees up. Every other gate (age,
 * security, forensic, freshness, allocatable) is sex-independent and belongs to the headline
 * number, not to the split beneath it. See the flag in this task's report.
 *
 * Fails CLOSED: if the gate cannot be found — it was renamed, or the verdict shape changed — this
 * returns `false`, so the board understates what it can offer rather than promising a bed it has
 * not checked. `tests/ward-board-derivations.test.ts` pins the gate's existence so that failure
 * mode announces itself instead of quietly zeroing the board.
