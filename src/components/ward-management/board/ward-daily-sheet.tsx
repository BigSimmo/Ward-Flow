/**
 * THE WARD'S DAILY SHEET — the page a charge nurse carries into the morning meeting.
 *
 * Spec: D19 ("the printed page is the ward's handover sheet ... who came in, who is going, who is
 * stuck, who is overdue"), DB-10 (the sheet is current at the moment it is printed, and the stamp
 * that says so is load-bearing), DB-11 (nothing is frozen — one live picture, on screen and on
 * paper) and DB-12 (the stamp must read the SAME instant the figures read).
 *
 * **It derives nothing.** Every figure and every row arrives as a prop, already computed by
 * `ward-board.tsx` from the shared derivations (`headlineAvailable`, `constraintSentence`,
 * `sinceYesterday`, `arrowTargets`, `derivedBedReleases`, `daysInBed`, `stayBand`,
 * `isPastExpectedDischarge`). That is deliberate and it is the whole safety property of this file:
 * a sheet that re-counted anything would be a second answer to a number a clinician is holding
 * next to the screen, and the two would disagree the first time either was corrected. The only
 * thing computed here is which of the already-built rows falls into which of D19's four groups —
 * a partition, never an arithmetic.
 *
 * **What it does NOT contain, and why.** D10's editable half — dates typed in a column, shorthand
 * like `+7`, the one "nothing has changed" button — is absent. That half of the daily sheet writes
 * to the model, and this board's exemption to read the admission seed is bounded precisely by its
 * dispatching nothing (spec DB-19); building the editable sheet here would break that boundary and
 * fire the companion assertion. It is a separate piece of work on a surface allowed to emit events.
 * Stated on the sheet itself, so nobody reads its absence as "there is nothing to update".
 */

/**
 * The "as at" stamp, and it is the safeguard DB-10 and DB-11 traded the frozen view for.
 *
 * **It reads the instant handed to it — the same `now` every figure on the sheet reads (DB-12).**
 * It must never call `wallClockNow()`: this prototype's screens take their `now` from a shared
 * value that a demo control can move, so a stamp on the wall clock beside figures from a moved
 * clock would assert a moment that is not the moment being shown. A stamp that can lie is worse
 * than no stamp, because the freeze was removed on the strength of it.
 *
 * **There is still no DATE, and that is stated rather than silently dropped — but the SAFEGUARD
 * DB-10 wanted now works.** DB-10 requires date AND time, for a real reason: paper outlives its
 * day, and a sheet stamped `15:22` read the next morning distinguishes nothing from one stamped
 * `15:22` the morning before. Two sheets that are two moments must not look like two claims about
 * one.
 *
 * A calendar date is still not available and is still not invented. But `a3d199fa7` gave an
 * `Instant` a DAY (`dayOf`), so the sheet can now carry which day of the demonstration it was
 * taken on — and that is sufficient for the failure DB-10 actually names, without fabricating the
 * one element the decision made load-bearing. Two sheets from different days are now visibly two
 * moments.
 *
 * **The `+ 1` is presentation and lives only here.** `dayOf` returns 0 for the opening day, and
 * "day 0" reads as a defect to anybody not holding `ward-clock.ts` open. Nothing computes from
 * this string; it is read aloud and pinned to a wall.
 *
 * **THE CALENDAR ARRIVED, AND THE SHEET STILL DOES NOT PRINT A DATE. That is a choice now, not a
 * limitation.** `b1198cf6e` gave the clock a real date (`dayZero` on the provider,
 * `calendarDateOf`), so this sheet COULD say "30 August". It does not, for two reasons, and the
 * second is the one that matters:
 *
 *   1. A reader of a ward sheet is oriented to now, not to a calendar — which is why
 *      `formatInstantWithDay` prefers "yesterday" and "3 days ago" over dates.
 *   2. **A dated sheet invites the reader to believe the FIGURES are dated, and they are not.**
 *      Every number on this page is synthetic. A real date beside invented figures is the one
 *      combination that makes a prototype look like a record.
 *
 * So the old "this prototype holds no calendar date" clause was removed the moment it became
 * false — it was a true statement about a missing capability, and leaving it in place after the
 * capability arrived would have made the sheet lie about the system rather than about the day.
 * What replaced it says what is actually true: the figures are synthetic, whatever the clock knows.
 *
 * A non-finite instant yields no time rather than `NaN:NaN` — the conservative direction this
 * whole feature takes: a sheet that cannot say when it was taken must not appear to.
