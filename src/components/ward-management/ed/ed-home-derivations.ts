/**
 * ⚠️ THE POPULATION THIS SCREEN COUNTS IS MOVEMENTS, NEVER REFERRALS — RULED, NOT GUESSED.
 *
 * The ED hub (`ed-screen.tsx`, one department at a time) was found counting REFERRALS raised
 * from a department — each row one referral addressed to it — while this screen counted
 * MOVEMENTS: a person's own open journey from an emergency department toward a psychiatric bed
 * (`Movement.originEdId`, `Movement.openedAt`, `isOpen`). **Those are different populations and
 * they disagreed on the same day for the same department** — a movement can exist with no
 * referral yet raised, and a referral can exist for someone no movement has been opened for.
 *
 * **Owner ruling, 2026-09-04: the population is the patient physically present, awaiting a bed —
 * the movement-based set — and the ED hub is being told the same, so the two screens agree by
 * construction rather than by fixture.** The reason given is clinical: "waiting for a psychiatric
 * bed" describes a person in a department, not a piece of paperwork, and a patient can be waiting
 * before any referral exists — the worst case this screen exists to surface, not an edge case. A
 * referral-keyed view has no row to hang that on. So a movement is the unit.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The ruling's first draft went on to say referral state — including its absence — becomes
 * an attribute of that person's row. That clause was corrected the same day: see the note on
 * "NOBODY IS LOOKING FOR A BED" below, which is why this screen counts NOTHING about
 * `referredUnitIds` or `declines`.**
 *
 * Every count on this screen is captioned with that population explicitly, in words, on every
 * panel that carries one (see `ed-home.tsx`/`ed-service-bands.tsx` and
 * `tests/ward-ed-home.dom.test.tsx`'s population-wording assertions) — precisely so a reader who
 * clicks through to a department's own hub is never surprised by a different number with no
 * explanation.

/**
 * ⚠️ THIS SCREEN DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COUNT "NOBODY IS LOOKING FOR A BED" — CORRECTED RULING,
 * 2026-09-04, AND IT IS A FINDING, NOT A STYLE CHOICE.
 *
 * A first draft of this screen counted `referredUnitIds.length === 0 && declines.length > 0` as
 * "declined by every ward, nobody now looking" — mirroring `handoverSnapshot`'s own
 * `declinedByAll` group in `ward-derivations.ts`. That predicate is real and correctly grounded
 * (WF-009 in `ward-movements.ts` is a genuine, hand-authored case of it), but the SAME shape of
 * claim was independently found broken one field over: `Movement.referralId`, read through
 * `referralForMovement`, is unset on every one of the twenty hand-seeded movements, so a screen
 * trusting its absence to mean "nobody has raised a referral" would report that for every patient
 * everywhere — a maximum-urgency claim, entirely fabricated, with every value honestly derived and
 * every test green.
 *
 * The ruling generalises rather than special-cases the one broken field: **an absence that could
 * mean "genuinely nobody is looking" OR "this record predates the field" OR "not yet actioned"
 * renders identically, and only the first is clinical.** This screen cannot tell those apart for
 * `referredUnitIds`/`declines` any more confidently than for `referralId` — most of
 * `routineMovements()`'s generated bulk never touches either field, so an aggregate "nobody
 * looking" figure here would be true for a handful of deliberately-authored fixture rows and
 * silent (not zero — MISSING) for everything else, which reads as "mostly fine" rather than
 * "not measured." **So: no figure, chip or banner anywhere on this screen claims that nobody is
 * looking for a bed, or counts a movement toward any total on that basis.** A movement's
 * `referredUnitIds` and `declines` are not read by this module at all. The owner has separately
 * been given this as a finding — whether the system CAN reliably say "nobody is looking for a
 * bed" is a data-gap question for him, not a design one this screen may answer in the meantime.
