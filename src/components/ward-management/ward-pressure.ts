/**
 * Worst first: a passed legal deadline outranks a long wait, which outranks sheer volume.
 *
 * MOVEMENTS ARE REQUIRED, and this parameter having a default is what the function was wrong for.
 *
 * It read `= wardMovements` — the seed module — so a caller who simply forgot to pass live state
 * got a plausible answer built from the fixture, with nothing failing anywhere. Both home-page
 * callers had forgotten: `FlowDiagram` called `edPressure(now)`, and `PressureStrip` declared its
 * own `movements` optional and was rendered without it. So raising a referral incremented the
 * queue while both ED panels beside it sat still — two panels on one screen disagreeing about one
 * department, and no test could see it because they all passed movements explicitly.
 *
 * The injection point itself was never the problem and is kept: it is the mirror of
 * `queueOrder(movements, now)` in `ward-priority.ts`, with the parameter order left as
 * `(now, movements)` because `now` is what every call site passes first. Without it every
 * assertion here would be forced to key off the one fixture, which happens to have every
 * department busy and every wait positive — that is what let three false-positive tests through
 * review the first time. What was wrong was making it OPTIONAL: an argument whose absence yields
 * a plausible answer cannot be forgotten loudly. Now every caller must say which state it means.
 *
 * The `open`/`waiting`/`longestWaitMinutes` figures below are a projection of `edOpenSummaries`
 * (`ed/ed-home-derivations.ts`), not a second copy of its computation — the two were found as
 * faithful duplicates (same `isOpen`/`originEdId` filter, same clamped-elapsed-minutes wait), and
 * the risk of keeping them separate was a silent divergence the day someone edits one and not the
 * other. `EdOpenSummary.open` is reused as-is rather than re-filtered, per its own doc comment.
 * Only `breaching` and the worst-first sort are unique to this module and stay here unchanged.
 *
 * Reads `edOpenSummaries` rather than `edHomeSummaries` (Task 6 of the audit-wiring plan,
 * 2026-09-16): nothing below reads `pastAccessTarget`/`detainedAndPastAccessTarget`, so this
 * function has no access target to be given and no configuration to thread through — a caller of
 * `edPressure` does not change.
