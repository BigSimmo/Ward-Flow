/**
 * Which side of the whole-network overview each health service's cluster sits on.
 *
 * The LEFT column is the one layout decision taken here, and it is roadmap 14's "country sites
 * present at all": the WA country service sits beside North Metro at the top of the picture rather
 * than below three metro clusters.
 *
 * Phase 8, Task 9 (spec D11, step 4). The RIGHT column is now DERIVED — everything else
 * `wardServiceOrder` knows about — where it used to be a hand-written copy of three of that list's
 * five entries. `wardServiceOrder` is already this screen's canonical service list (`measure()`
 * walks it to draw the demand trunks), so the copy was a second list that had to agree with it and
 * could drift. That drift has exactly one symptom: a service added to the model but not to the copy
 * renders no cluster, and every unit in it is simply not on the screen. **A unit missing from the
 * whole-network overview reads as "no such bed exists"**, which is the worst thing a bed-finding
 * screen can say, and it arrives through layout rather than through any claim about distance.
 *
 * Deriving one list from the other removes that particular way in. It is NOT by itself a proof that
 * every unit is drawn — `wardServiceOrder` is still hand-written, and a unit whose site is missing
 * from the site table would still vanish. The proof is the test: the overview's card set is pinned
 * to `allUnits()` in `tests/ward-network-referral-placement.dom.test.tsx`.
 *
 * Today's picture is unchanged: the filter yields East Metro, South Metro, Private, in that order.
 *
 * One property of the list this now depends on, written down rather than assumed: `wardServiceOrder`
 * is exported as a mutable `HealthService[]`, so a caller that reordered or spliced it in place
 * would silently move or drop a whole column here. Nothing mutates it today — this is a note for
 * whoever is tempted to, not a defect being reported. The order on screen is pinned against the
 * model in `tests/ward-network-referral-placement.dom.test.tsx`, so such a mutation fails a test
 * rather than quietly changing the picture.

 * person was triaged and sitting in a department.
 *
 * ⚠️ MEASURED ON THE SEED, AND THE MEASUREMENT CORRECTED MY OWN CLAIM. Four hours into the
 * demonstration `RF-003` reads "4h 55m waiting" against a true referral wait of 25 MINUTES — nearly
 * twelvefold. I was about to report that as visible here. IT IS NOT: `RF-003` is `accepted`, and
 * `referralQueueOrder` filters to `queued`, so this screen never shows it. Every referral this
 * queue DOES show was triaged before the referral was raised, so the old label was right for all
 * of them.
 *
 * So on this surface the defect is LATENT rather than live — the wrong function was wired in, and
 * the fixture happens to contain no queued referral that exposes it. It becomes visible the moment
 * a queued referral is triaged during a demonstration; `RF-001` is queued and not yet in a
 * department, so triaging it does exactly that.
 *
 * ⚠️ AN INFLATED WAIT IS WHY THIS SURVIVES ANYWHERE: a wrong clock looks wrong, a wrong length of
 * stay looks plausible. The fixture's own longest wait is hours, so a doubled figure reads as a
 * busy night rather than as a bug.
 *
 * Wording comes from `REFERRAL_CLOCK_TERMS`, never from here — the same rule as `urgencyTierLabel`
 * below, because a second spelling of one field is this project's most expensive defect class.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEVER SAY "ARRIVED". The field is `triagedAt`. A patient arrives, waits, and is triaged some
 * time later; on a busy night that gap is not small. "In department" is measured from triage and

 * Exported so both branches can be driven directly: NEITHER is reachable through the full
 * component and the seeded fixture alone, because the seed's own first movement (`WF-001`) is
 * already open, and closing every one of fifty seeded movements to reach the empty case is not a
 * reasonable ask of a test. Same reasoning `isOfficerJob` (officer-screen.tsx) and
