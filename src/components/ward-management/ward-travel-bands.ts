 * and `REFERRAL_SOURCES` already hold to. A hand-written second copy of these names is how two
 * screens end up disagreeing about what bands exist.
 *
 * A band is a fact about a PAIR — a home region and a hospital site. It belongs to neither, so it
 * is never stored on a `Site`, a `Unit`, a `Referral`, a `Movement`, an event, a snapshot or a
 * cache; it is only ever looked up. That is what keeps replacing this file's values the whole
 * change on the day somebody replaces them with checked ones.
 *
 * `air_transport_only` sits last for grouping order and for nothing else. It is a statement about
 * HOW you get somewhere, not about how long it takes — a flight can be shorter than a drive, and
 * this prototype knows nothing about how anyone actually travels.

 * longer carries invented placeholders, and it TURNS OFF the guard in
 * `tests/ward-travel-bands.test.ts` that forbids any home region being recorded at every site in
 * the network. That guard exists only because a suspiciously complete table of INVENTED values is
 * how a placeholder starts reading as a checked fact. Once the values are checked, completeness is
 * a virtue, and the guard would instead be pressuring somebody to withhold real data to keep a
 * test green — which is worse than the fill-in it guards against. Flip the flag in the same change
 * that replaces the values; never before, and never to make a test pass.
 *
 * Deliberately a boolean and nothing else. A count, a date, a proportion or a threshold here would
 * be a figure this phase must not author, and would need a provenance record of its own.

/** SYNTHETIC. Every band below is invented, exactly like every bed number in `ward-sites.ts`.
 *  Nobody has measured or checked the real travel time between any WA region and any hospital in
 *  this table, and no value here was chosen to resemble one — the pairs recorded were chosen to
 *  exercise the four bands, the sparse case and the whole-region gap. Not every pair is recorded,
 *  and an unrecorded pair is `undefined` — never a default, never the nearest band, never
 *  "unknown means far".
 *
 *  HOW THE VALUES WERE PICKED, so a later reader does not mistake them for research. No map,
 *  atlas, search or recollection of Western Australian geography was consulted. Which pairs are
 *  recorded was chosen for coverage: every band live, at least one site unrecorded inside a
 *  recorded region, at least one whole region unrecorded that a seeded referral uses, and at
 *  least two units sharing one band. Which band each recorded pair got was then decided
 *  mechanically by LIST POSITION — the band at index (region's position in `HOME_REGIONS` plus
 *  the site's position in `wardSites`) modulo the number of bands — so that no step of the
 *  authoring could smuggle in a judgement about how far anywhere actually is. Some results read
 *  as obviously wrong for the real places named. That is the point, and it is safer than a table
 *  that reads as though somebody checked it.
 *
 *  Replacing these values with checked ones is a change to this object and nothing else. */
