 * The control beside it is a `<select>` over that same list, never a textarea.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS CORRECTION WAS ITSELF WRONG, WHICH IS THE MORE USEFUL HALF.**
 * It said the paragraph had "misinformed another session" — that Ward Referrals read a rotted
 * comment and filed a request for work already done. **That was not what happened.** The reason
 * field exists on `claude/ward-flow-phases-6-7-design` and does NOT exist on
 * `claude/ward-flow-wave1-referral-corrections`, where that session was standing. **On its branch
 * both the comment and its request were correct.** There was no stale comment and no victim; there
 * were two branches, and I compared its report against my own working tree and read the difference
 * as its mistake.
 *
 * So this paragraph is stale HERE, on this branch, from the day `OD-3` landed here — and it is
 * accurate anywhere the event has not arrived. **An observation carries its branch as well as its
 * date, and a fact with its position stripped off looks like a fact about the world.** I had quoted
 * that exact rule at another session hours earlier, after it reported a defect class closed from a
 * grep on one branch.
 *
 * Override still keeps local state, for a smaller reason than the one this used to give: the
 * `<select>` needs a value between choosing a reason and submitting it. This record is never
 * trusted at face value either: `overrideSucceeded` below reads
 * `movement.referredUnitIds` fresh on every render and only renders a success message when those
 * ids are actually present there, so a refused override (the movement was not in a referable

              :410, where it feeds the INERT plain-Refer button's `title`.
              And that was the whole problem. Until now the failing gate reached a sighted mouse
              user ONLY as a tooltip on a button they cannot click, plus an `sr-only` span. A
              coordinator on a touch screen never saw it. One moving by keyboard never saw it. One
              who had scrolled past never saw it. So at the only irreversible moment, for a large
              class of users, the advice was never legible at all.
              The owner ruled "keep advising and let the clinician decide". THIS IS THAT RULING'S
              REMAINING WORK — advising where the decision is actually taken.
              ⚠️ NOT A GATE. It does not disable Override, does not add a confirmation step, and
              does not touch `canOverride`. It states the reason and leaves the decision where the
              owner put it.

              TWO BLOCKERS, NOT ONE — and the first version of this block rendered for only one of
              them. Refer can be unavailable because a selected ward is ineligible OR because the
              movement's own stage is not referable, and `canOverride` deliberately carries neither
              guard: overriding a non-referable stage is a documented, intended path (see the
              comment on `canOverride`). Keying this block on `firstIneligibleSelected` alone meant
              a coordinator overriding a STAGE block, with every selected ward eligible, opened the
              form and read nothing at all — the same silence at the same moment, from the other
              cause. Found by Ward Verifier, against my own comment forty lines up that had already
              said the stage path existed.

              ⚠️ BOTH REASONS RENDER WHEN BOTH APPLY, and the stage reason leads. The button shows
              one reason because it has room for one; this form is the moment of the irreversible
              act, and showing only the higher-precedence one would leave a coordinator who has
              just overridden the stage block still unaware the ward is ineligible — which is this
              defect again, one layer down. Leading with the stage matches `referUnavailableReason`
              above, so the form and the button never disagree about which reason comes first.

                        reference id, returns null and renders NOTHING. Never "unknown", never a
                        dash — a dash in a distance column reads as "close" to anyone skimming it.

                        OpenStreetMap data with no traffic, no peak and no ambulance behaviour, and
                        the ED pin is the hospital campus rather than its door. Every row carries
                        the caveat in its title so the figure cannot travel without it. Nothing in

                        never touched by this — bed eligibility decides that, as it always has.

                        ⚠️ THE TESTID MUST NOT BEGIN `ward-shortlist-candidate-`. Test helpers select
                        the candidate rows with `getAllByTestId(/^ward-shortlist-candidate-/)`, so a
                        child using that prefix is counted AS a candidate, and the row a test then
                        clicks is a text span that selects nothing. A testid prefix is a namespace
                        other files select on, not a label. Cost an hour on 2026-09-18.

                        ⚠️ AND THE CAVEAT IS NOT A `title`. This panel already removed a tooltip once,
                        for a reason its own test still pins: a `title` is invisible on a touch screen
                        and to a keyboard, so it reaches nobody who needs it. The caveat is rendered
                        as text under the list instead. */}
