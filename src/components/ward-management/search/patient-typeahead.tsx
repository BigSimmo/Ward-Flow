/**
 * THE PATIENT TYPEAHEAD — a name box that shows you who it found while you are still typing.
 *
 * Owner request, 2026-09-05: "a smart patient dropdown for me when typing patient names."
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT "SMART" IS NOT ALLOWED TO MEAN HERE, and this is the whole design.
 *
 * `nearPatients` in `ward-patients.ts` already settled this question for its own output and the
 * ruling binds this component too: it returns candidates *"deliberately UNRANKED: presenting a
 * 'best' match is an invitation, and on this screen an invitation is the hazard."* So this dropdown
 * does not score, does not rank, and does not put a most-likely person at the top. It groups, it
 * labels each group with the rule that produced it, and it leaves the choosing to the clinician.
 *
 * Three consequences, each of which looks like a missing feature and is not:
 *
 *   1. **NOTHING IS PRESELECTED.** `activeIndex` starts at −1 and stays there until the clinician
 *      presses an arrow key. A dropdown that highlights its first row has already made the choice;
 *      pressing Enter out of habit then picks a patient nobody read. On a screen whose output is a
 *      human being's record, that is the failure worth engineering against.
 *   2. **NEAR-SPELLINGS APPEAR ONLY WHEN NOTHING MATCHED.** `nearPatients`'s own contract is that
 *      it is *"offered only to a clinician the search has already told 'nobody is known', and never
 *      as a match."* Mixing one-keystroke candidates in beside real matches would turn a suggestion
 *      into a result. They get their own group, under their own heading, below an explicit sentence
 *      saying nobody actually matched.
 *   3. **EVERY OPTION CARRIES THE TWO FACTS THAT DISTINGUISH PEOPLE** — record number and date of
 *      birth — because the near-spelling pairs seeded into this system (Halloway/Hallowin,
 *      Marrowby/Marrowbee, O'Quinn/Oquinn) are indistinguishable by name alone, on purpose.
 *
 * What it DOES add over a bare text field: it tells you, before you commit, whether the person you
 * are typing already has a referral still waiting for a decision. That is the fact a clinician is
 * usually actually after, and today it costs a search, a scan and a click to reach.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT CANNOT TELL YOU WHETHER THEY ARE ON A MOVEMENT, BECAUSE THE MODEL CANNOT.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AN EARLIER DRAFT OF THIS COMMENT SAID "`Movement` CARRIES NO PATIENT LINK OF ANY KIND".
 * THAT WAS WRONG, AND WRONG IN THE DIRECTION THAT GETS A FINDING DISMISSED** — the next reader
 * greps, finds `Movement.referralId`, and concludes the whole paragraph is unreliable. Corrected
 * after Ward Lead caught it; re-measured here rather than taken on trust.
 *
 * What is actually true, measured against `ward-model.ts` at `d5f0fcc05`: the link exists and is
 * **two optional hops long**. `Movement.referralId?: string` (`:718`) → `Referral` →
 * `Referral.patientId?: PatientId` (`:1463`, added by the owner's ruling of 2026-09-02).
 * `referralForMovement` (`ward-derivations.ts:287`) returns `undefined` the moment the first hop
 * is absent.
 *
 * **And the first hop is absent in the ordinary case: 2 of the 20 hand-authored movements carry a
 * `referralId`; the other 18 carry nothing** (that field's own comment, owner ruling
 * `R-2026-09-04-D`). So the sharpened statement is worse for the product than the wrong one was:
 * a partial link compiles, resolves for a tenth of the fixture, and returns `undefined` for the
 * rest — and an `undefined` rendered as "nothing attached" reads as an answer rather than as a
 * gap. That is precisely the defect this component's first draft had. A first draft of this file
 * looked up `movements.find((m) => m.patientId === patient.id)` and would not have compiled; had it
 * compiled against a looser type it would have rendered "Nothing attached" for every patient on a
 * movement, which reads as an answer rather than as an absence. **The gap is reported here rather
 * than papered over, and closing it is a model decision for the owner, not a UI one.**
 *
 * ⚠️ IT ASSESSES NOTHING. No risk, no acuity, no priority, no ordering by need. The screen this
 * mounts on promises a clinician it never does, and a dropdown that quietly sorted by anything
 * clinical would break that promise where nobody would look for it.
 *
 * Keyboard, per the ARIA 1.2 combobox pattern: ArrowDown/ArrowUp move, Home/End jump, Enter picks
 * the active option (and does nothing when none is active), Escape closes without picking.

        The count is announced rather than only drawn, because a clinician using a screen reader

        The marker rides the NOUN ("2 invented names found") rather than following as its own
        clause ("2 names found. These are invented."), because this sentence is re-spoken on every
        keystroke: a qualifier costs one word in something that was going to be said anyway, where
        a second sentence doubles what a typeahead user hears each time they type a letter.

        And the noun is NAMES, not people, in both branches. That is the standard's own fixed word
        for this population — §8.6's results footer is "Names are invented", and §8.5's disclaimer
        is "Every figure and name on this screen is invented". The standard attaches invention to
        the NAME wherever it speaks about persons (§8.3 forbids inventing "a person's name that
        could be mistaken for real"), and never to the person. On a bed board that distinction is
        stylistic; on a patient search it is not, because this is the one figure on the screen that
        is a claim about human beings rather than about beds. "2 invented people found" was the
        implementer's phrasing and is Ward Lead's to rule on, not theirs — ruled D-8.

        ⚠️ The page-level markers this screen relies on (the bar's prototype tooltip and the rail
        foot, standard §8.3) are BOTH visual. A screen-reader user reaches neither, which is why
        the marker has to be in the sentence at all.

/**
 * One person in the list.
 *
 * The referral line is the reason this component earns its place: it answers "is this person
 * already waiting on somebody" without a second search. It reads the live referral list directly
 * rather than a precomputed index, so it can never disagree with the board a click away.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE "NOTHING FOUND" WORDING IS "NO REFERRAL LINKED TO THIS RECORD", NEVER "NOTHING ATTACHED"
 * AND NEVER "NO REFERRAL ON RECORD". "Nothing attached" would be a claim about movements as well,
 * and this component cannot see movements from a person — see the model gap in the component doc
 * above. "No referral ON RECORD" is a stronger claim than this component can support for a
 * different reason: `patientId` is an OPTIONAL pointer (`ward-model.ts`) that today sits unset on
 * every seeded referral, so this line renders for people who genuinely DO have a referral sitting
 * in the queue — it just isn't linked to their patient record yet. "On record" reads as "this
 * person has no referral", which is a fact about the WORLD this component cannot see. "Linked to
 * this record" states only the fact it actually knows: no referral POINTS here. A sentence must
 * not be wider than the data behind it.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE FOUND-REFERRAL LINE NAMES THE ACTUAL STATE, NEVER A FIXED "WAITING FOR A DECISION".
 * `referralState` (`ward-referrals.ts`) returns "queued" | "accepted" | "declined", and a chip that
 * said "waiting for a decision" regardless of which one it read was a false statement about anyone
 * whose bed was already agreed, or whose referral every destination had refused. The page below
 * this control already applies the state filter; this component didn't, so the two could disagree
 * about the same referral on the same screen.
