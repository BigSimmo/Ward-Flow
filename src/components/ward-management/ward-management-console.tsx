 * It was invisible until 2026-09-06 only because the one fixture path that reaches it needs a
 * control that did not exist. `DECLINE` and `RELEASE_PULL` reach it too.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NO TEXT IS AUTHORED HERE.** Every label comes from the map that already owns that list —
 * this resolves, it does not name. Authoring a fifth vocabulary would be the "two places for one
 * fact" this project forbids, and `tests/ward-console-timeline-reasons.test.ts` pins that every
 * reason the reducer can write is covered by one of these four.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A MISS RETURNS `undefined`, AND THE CALLER THEN PRINTS THE FACT WITHOUT THE REASON. Never

   * ward, which knows when it is ready, triggers them"*, so they are not relying on their own
   * memory. **`TR-D1` shipped. Its mitigation did not**, and the ledger's own status audit named
   * this as the one row to act on.
   *
   * ⚠️ **NO NEW EVENT AND NO NEW FIELD, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PROPOSAL THIS CAME FROM.**
   * The readiness signal already exists and it is `PULL_PATIENT` — refused when the ward has no
   * allocatable bed, refused when every free bed is still being made ready, refused when
   * specialling capacity would be exhausted. A `SIGNAL_READY` event would be a second act meaning
   * the same thing at strictly lower safety. **The pull is already recorded, with a time. What was
   * missing was somebody being told.**

   * not a gap, and prompting a booking against it would be the software overriding a person.

   * read at source before this was written.** *"It stays a convenience, and a 'confirm with the
   * ward' step goes on any placement action."* His reasoning is the hazard it settles: **a good
   * board becomes the source of truth without anybody deciding it has.** He has decided it has not.
   *
   * **This prompt is exactly the shape that ruling is about.** It reads a bed off the board and
   * tells somebody to commit a vehicle to it — and the board can be behind: `RELEASE_PULL` hands
   * the bed back and this page has to be looked at to know. A booking made on a stale figure is a
   * real crew dispatched to a bed that is gone, which is the defect the orphaned-job surface below
   * exists to catch AFTER the fact. **Confirming first is what stops it happening.**
   *
   * ⚠️ **IT BOUNDS THE CLAIM, NOT THE CARE.** The ruling does not license treating this figure as

/**
 * ⚠️ **THIS IS A MOVEMENT WORKSPACE, AND ITS PROP NOW SAYS SO.** It was `patientId: string`, and
 * the body looks the value up in `movements` — so the name invited a real patient id and nothing
 * stopped one being passed. It worked only because every call site happened to pass a movement.
 * The prop is now `movementId: MovementId`, so the mistake the old name invited fails to compile
 * rather than rendering a dead-end "no movement matches" page.
 *
 * The ROUTE was `/patients/[patientId]` and just as misleading to a human reader
 * as the prop had been to the compiler. It has since moved to
 * `/mockups/ward-flow/movements/[movementId]`, nested under the existing `movements` mode page —
 * the site map, the reachability assertion and this file's own doc comment all moved with it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE PAGE HAS A TENSE NOW, AND THAT WAS THE DEFECT UNDER MOST OF THE OTHERS** (Ward Lead
 * ruling 2, 2026-09-04). A closed movement is a DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENT of this page, not the same
 * page with a banner on top: what happened comes first and dominant, the live tools demote and go
 * quiet, "Current stage" becomes "Stopped at", and the step track shows where it stopped rather
 * than a highlighted step nobody is standing on.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE READER IS A COORDINATOR WHO ARRIVED FROM A LIST.** Every route in is a list — patient
 * search, the tracker's review link, four mode screens, the network view — so this page never has
 * to introduce the patient. It opens on the answer: what is wrong, then what it means, then the
 * three things a person can actually do.
 */
/**
 * ⚠️ **THE ROUTE USED TO QUOTE BACK AN ID THE USER NEVER TYPED.** `MovementId` is the template
 * literal type `` `WF-${string}` ``, so the bare string `"WF-"` satisfies it — and the route was
 * using exactly that as a sentinel for "this is not a movement id at all", handing it to a page
 * whose not-found sentence then quoted it. `/movements/PT-004` rendered *No synthetic movement
 * matches “WF-”*. Well-typed, so `tsc` could not see it; asserted by no test; and a page telling a
 * clinician something they did not type is the kind of thing that ends up in a screenshot.
 *
 * The sentinel is gone. The route now renders this component directly for a wrong-shaped id, so
 * there is no cast on that path and nothing to quote back wrongly, and the two cases say different
 * things because they ARE different: one is "that is not the sort of thing this screen shows", the
 * other is "it is, and there is no such one".
 *
 * 🔴 AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS FIX INTRODUCED A WORSE FALSE STATEMENT THAN THE ONE IT REPLACED.
 * It ended "a person is not a movement, and their record is not reachable from here." A person's
 * record IS reachable: `/mockups/ward-flow/people/[patientId]` renders it, and the patient search
 * links straight to it. So the page sent a coordinator AWAY from the screen holding what they
 * wanted, fluently and with authority. **The old bug quoted nonsense and the reader looked
 * elsewhere; this one was believable.** Caught by an adversarial review, not by me, and not by any
 * test. The lesson is the one worth keeping: every one of these six fixes replaced a sentence with
 * another sentence, and a replacement is a new claim that needs checking exactly as hard as the
 * one it removes.

             * It used to print the legal status the masthead and the legal panel both already
             * carried, the form line the legal panel carries, the transport sentence the transport
             * panel carries word for word, and the blocker prose the attention rail, the control
             * and Movement facts all carried. On WF-004 that made the blocker sentence the FOURTH
             * thing a coordinator met that said the same thing, and each encounter cost them a
             * decision about whether it was new.
             *
             * The rule the page now follows: EVERY FACT HAS ONE HOME, and a panel that would
             * repeat one either omits it or points at it. Readiness owns none of these four facts.
             * What it owns — and what nothing else on the page says — is whether each one is in a
             * state that lets this patient travel. So each row is a derived verdict plus where the
             * fact itself lives.
             *
             * ⚠️ AND IT HAS A TENSE (Ward Lead D5). On a closed movement the old header still read
             * "before this patient can travel", about a patient who will never travel — the one
             * panel the earlier tense pass missed.
             *
             * ⚠️ WHAT MUST NOT BE UNDONE: the absences stay distinct. "Nobody ever recorded one"
             * and "somebody cleared the one that was there" are different facts about a patient,
             * and `BLOCKERS_MEANING_NOTHING_IS_BLOCKING` exists to keep the five of them apart.
             * Removing repetition is not licence to collapse them into "none".

   * Measured 2026-09-04, when this said THREE: record a blocker, clear a blocker, flag the patient
   * as urgent. That is all it was. Scattering them among twelve panels was part of why the page
   * read as an inventory rather than a workspace.
   *
   * ⚠️ **FIVE SINCE 2026-09-06** — withdrawing a ward's acceptance and correcting the recorded
   * stage were added below — **AND SIX WHEN A TRANSPORT JOB HAS OUTLIVED ITS BED**, which is the
   * one control here that appears conditionally. The count is stated in the blurb a coordinator
   * reads, so a control added without touching that sentence makes the page lie about itself; that
   * is why this note names the number rather than leaving it to be counted, and why the blurb
   * branches rather than saying "five or six".
   *
   * ⚠️ CALLED AS A FUNCTION, NEVER RENDERED AS `<WhatYouCanDo />`. A component declared inside
   * another component is a NEW component type on every render, so React unmounts and remounts its
   * whole subtree each time — which here would blow away the focus and caret of the blocker text
   * field on every keystroke. Calling it returns the same element tree into the parent's own
   * reconciliation and has no such effect. It stays a closure because it reads `patient`, `now`,
   * `dispatch` and the blocker draft, and because rendering it from exactly two places (open, near
   * the top; closed, last and quiet) is what stops the two arrangements diverging.

           *
           * 🔴 **A REAL VEHICLE AND A REAL CREW, DISPATCHED AGAINST A BED THAT HAS GONE BACK TO THE
           * WARD.** Measured through the reducer: pull, book, release — the job survives untouched,
           * and then BLOCKS the replacement, because `BOOK_TRANSPORT` refuses a second job. The
           * failure compounds toward the patient not moving at all.
           *
           * ⚠️ **THE RELEASE IS ALLOWED TO PROCEED AND THAT IS THE RULING, NOT AN OVERSIGHT.**
           * Cancelling inside `RELEASE_PULL` would make one act silently do two and destroy a
           * provider's acceptance without telling them. Refusing `RELEASE_PULL` while a job exists
           * looks safest and is the most harmful: the bed is already gone in reality, and *a rule
           * that cannot be overridden does not stop the event, it stops the record of it* — so the
           * release would simply happen off-system and this board would go stale. **The job is made
           * loud and a person cancels it deliberately.**
           *
           * ⚠️ **AND IT SAYS WHO MAY ACT RATHER THAN OFFERING A CONTROL THAT WOULD BE REFUSED.**
           * `EVENT_ROLE` measured 2026-09-06: `BOOK_TRANSPORT` permitted `ed`, `ward` and
           * `community`; `CANCEL_TRANSPORT` permitted only `coordinator` and `ed`. **So a ward or a
           * community team could book transport and could not cancel it**, and TR-D5 is explicit
           * that a ward books too. That asymmetry was put to the owner as an authority question.
           *
           * 🔴 **WLQ-11 (owner, 2026-09-15) ANSWERED IT, IN PART:** *"whoever booked transport may
           * cancel it; the receiving ward still may not."* `ward` is back in
           * `EVENT_ROLE.CANCEL_TRANSPORT`, and `CANCEL_TRANSPORT`'s own `ward` branch
           * (`ward-flow-reducer.ts`) checks the finer distinction against `transport.bookedBy`: the
           * booking ward may cancel, every other ward — including the receiving one — is refused.
           * **The community half is NOT built:** no event records which community team acted, so a
           * community booker can never be told apart from another team, and `community` was never
           * added to `EVENT_ROLE.CANCEL_TRANSPORT`. The sentence below now branches on
           * `transport.bookedBy` for exactly this reason — it names the booking ward by name only
           * when the record can prove one, and otherwise falls back to the original
           * coordinator/ED-only sentence, which stays true for a job with no recorded booker (every
           * job booked before this ruling existed) and for one a community team booked. It never
           * claims a community team can cancel, because it still cannot.
           *
           * This page dispatches as the coordinator, who may cancel unconditionally, so here the
           * control is live regardless of which sentence renders.

   * ⚠️ THE CLOSED BRANCH USED TO COLLAPSE ALL FIVE FACTS INTO TWO, THREE LINES BELOW A COMMENT
   * SAYING THEY "ARE FIVE DIFFERENT FACTS AND STAY THAT WAY". It returned "Nothing was recorded as
   * holding this up" for every closed movement without an active blocker — so WF-007 rendered that
   * sentence on the same page as "None — handover complete", which IS a record, three inches away.
   * The page contradicted itself and asserted an absence of information it was simultaneously
   * displaying. Found by reading fifty rendered pages after the suite was green.
   *
   * ⚠️ TWO OF THE FIVE HAD NEVER BEEN ON A SCREEN, AND THE REASON MATTERS MORE THAN THE FACT.
   * `PATIENT_ARRIVED` writes `blocker: "None — handover complete"` and `closure` in the SAME
   * object, and the two non-arrival closures do the same for "None — the movement did not
   * proceed", so **no reducer flow can produce either value on an open movement.** They belong in
   * the closed branch and were only in the open one, which is why a closed movement fell through
   * to the collapsed sentence above.
   *
   * 🔴 BUT THEY ARE NOT UNREACHABLE UNDER `open`, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS COMMENT SAID THEY
   * WERE. The free-text blocker box dispatches `RECORD_MOVEMENT_BLOCKER` with the draft exactly as
   * typed, and that event's near-miss guard only refuses a CASE variant
   * (`inactive.toLowerCase() === blocker.toLowerCase() && inactive !== blocker`) — an EXACT match
   * escapes it and is stored verbatim. So the open arms stay. Deleting them as dead would have
   * made a reachable state print "Nobody has recorded anything as holding this up" over a value
   * somebody had just typed, which is the same false-absence defect this whole function is being
   * repaired for.
   *
   * The exact-string escape is a separate open question — it lets a coordinator stamp "handover
   * complete" on a patient who has not arrived — and is recorded in the tracker rather than
   * decided here.
