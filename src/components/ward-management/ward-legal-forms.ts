/**
 * The legal forms a clinician may choose from, and how a form names itself on screen.
 *
 * **Why this is its own module rather than part of `ward-model.ts`.** `ward-model.ts` declares
 * `ED_ACCESS_TARGET_MINUTES` — the departmental access target, a performance measure that has
 * already been mistaken for a legal deadline once. `tests/ward-flow-single-source.test.ts` keeps
 * the two quarantined: no file that spells out a `{code, kind}` legal-form literal may also
 * reference that constant. (That predicate was `{code, label, kind}` until this same change
 * deleted `LegalForm.label`; it was re-pointed to the two fields a populated form still carries,
 * which matches a strict superset of what it did before.) Declaring the list beside the constant tripped that guard, which
 * was the guard doing its job, so the list moved rather than the guard being relaxed.
 */

/**
 * The legal forms the intake picker offers, in the order it offers them. This list is the
 * single source for that picker, so admitting a further code later is a one-line change here.
 *
 * The software no longer decides which form a patient is on; the clinician chooses it and it
 * never changes by itself. Product owner, 2026-08-24: "A patient will be on 1A or 3D or other
 * forms potentially… so avoid any hard rules now please. Just focus on voluntary and
 * involuntary and I can choose what option in the patient selection." `RAISE_REFERRAL` no
 * longer derives a form from `legalStatus`, and `RECORD_EXAMINATION` no longer replaces or
 * clears one.
 *
 * **An entry carries a code, and no meaning.** Titles come from the register at render time
 * (`legalFormName`), never from here — the product owner approved adopting the official titles
 * on 2026-08-24 after being shown that this prototype's own labels had drifted from them.
 * `kind` is retained only because the fixture and the type already carried it; nothing reads
 * it, it is never displayed, and Form 3D has none because this model holds no classification
 * for a 3D and the register's categories were explicitly not adopted.
 *
 * No entry carries a `dueAt`. Forms record *that* they exist, never *when they lapse* — see
 * `LegalForm`'s own doc comment and `tests/ward-legal-figure-guard.test.ts`.
