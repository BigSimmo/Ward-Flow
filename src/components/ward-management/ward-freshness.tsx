/**
 * Task 4. Spec D7: every Ward Flow board must state when its data was last true. This is the
 * ONE shared stamp every board renders rather than each inventing its own wording.
 *
 * Four renderings, chosen in this order, and no fifth:
 *
 * 1. `derived` is true → "As at 10:42" — the screen's own statement that the figure it is
 *    showing is computed rather than confirmed by anyone. This is a prop rather than something
 *    inferred from `confirmedAt`/`confirmedByRole` because spec D7's third case ("where the
 *    screen shows derived rather than confirmed data") is a property of the SCREEN, not of the
 *    data passed in — a screen can have nothing confirmed and still not be showing a derived
 *    figure (see case 3 below), so only the screen itself can say which situation it is in.
 * 2. Both `confirmedAt` and `confirmedByRole` are present → "Confirmed 10:22 · Ward 2K".
 * 3. `confirmedAt` is present but `confirmedByRole` is not → "Confirmed 10:22" — a group-level
 *    freshness (a whole hospital or the whole network, `RollupFreshness` in
 *    `ward-morning-rollup.ts`) has an oldest contributing confirmation instant but no single
 *    confirming role to name, since it rolls up many wards' own confirmations. Phase 6's morning
 *    page reuses this branch rather than inventing a second freshness vocabulary — see
 *    `morning-page.tsx`'s `FreshnessLine`.
 * 4. Otherwise → "Never confirmed". This is the floor: a board with nothing to report never
 *    renders a blank or a dash, both of which would be claims this component must not make.
 *
 * Never reads a clock itself — `now` (and `confirmedAt`) always arrive from the caller, per
 * `ward-clock.ts`'s rule that it is the only module permitted to read the wall clock.
