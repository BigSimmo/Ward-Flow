 * on its timeframe invites the reader to supply one — "confirmed *today*", almost certainly.
 * `rollupFreshness` above makes exactly one distinction, **ever-confirmed versus never**; there is

 * string carries "today", "recently", "in the last hour" or a clock face, it becomes a second
 * freshness vocabulary and `ward-freshness.tsx` owns that. **The risk is not this wording; it is the
 * wording somebody adds when a reader asks "confirmed when?" — an obvious question whose answer is a
