 * which day, `minuteOfDay` for the clock face. Differences between two instants are plain

 * how many days apart they are, so a negative difference is ASSUMED to mean exactly one rollover.

 * over a missing concept rather than a solution.
 *
 * This carries the date, so the difference between two readings is simply their difference, over any
 * span. Dividing by `MINUTES_PER_DAY` gives the local day, which is what makes "which day is this
 * instant on" answerable at all.
 *
 * Local rather than UTC deliberately: a ward's day starts at local midnight, and a demonstration in
 * Perth that rolled its day over at 08:00 because the epoch is UTC would be wrong in the one way
 * nobody would think to check. The daylight-saving jump is accepted - Western Australia does not
