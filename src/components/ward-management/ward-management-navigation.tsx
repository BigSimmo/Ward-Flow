/**
 * Ward Flow's sidebar, in the three shapes the rest of this repository already uses (see
 * `src/components/clinical-dashboard/ClinicalSidebar.tsx`):
 *
 * - **Phone (below 40rem):** no rail at all. A fixed header bar carries the brand and a menu
 *   button that opens a left drawer holding the full labelled navigation, which closes on
 *   navigate. Before this, the 4.5rem desktop icon column rendered unchanged on a 390px phone —
 *   18% of the viewport — because `ward-management.module.css` contained no width media query
 *   that touched the rail at all. The bar is the sidebar's own, not a host's: nine of the ten
 *   Ward Flow shells are a bare rail-plus-main grid with no header row for a trigger to live in.
 * - **Tablet (40rem to 64rem):** the icon rail, with a plain brand link and no expand control,
 *   because the expanded panel does not exist at this width — exactly how `ClinicalCollapsedRail`
 *   behaves between md and lg.
 * - **Desktop (64rem and up):** the icon rail or a 17rem labelled panel, chosen by the user and
 *   remembered per browser by `useWardSidebarCollapsed`. Hovering the brand mark reveals the
 *   expand control, as it does in the clinical sidebar.
 *
 * Every destination in all three shapes is read from `ward-nav.ts`. The views used to be
 * hand-written link blocks in `WardModeNavigation` below; a labelled panel cannot read
 * those, and copying them would have re-created the two-lists-drifting defect (D8/D9) that file
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NO HOST SCREEN MOUNTS THIS COMPONENT ANY MORE (Task 8, 2026-09-11).** The per-screen mount
 * this paragraph used to describe — every ward screen owning its own copy of this sidebar — is
 * exactly the pattern `src/app/mockups/ward-flow/layout.tsx`'s own doc comment argued against and
 * finally replaced with a single mount of `shell/ward-rail.tsx` there. `grep -rn "<ClinicalRail"
 * src --include=*.tsx` finds no JSX mount at all today — re-run it rather than trusting that
 * absence to still hold, the same way the sentence it replaces should have re-run it instead of
 * repeating a number. This function itself is left in place, unmounted, rather than deleted: no
 * task has yet reviewed it against this repository's dead-code-removal contract
 * (`docs/agents/dead-code-deletion.md`).
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS SENTENCE USED TO SAY "all ten host screens" AND WAS WRONG BY A FACTOR OF NEARLY
 * THREE**, then said "35 mounts across 27 files" and was wrong again the moment this task's own
 * removal landed. A count typed into prose beside a mount site that keeps changing is a claim
 * that falsifies itself and then goes on being read; the number stays dropped, and the command
 * above is what stands in its place.
