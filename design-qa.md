# Ward Flow constellation design QA

> **Superseded (2026-09-02).** Point-in-time QA handoff from 2026-08-19 (PR #2140), kept as the
> record of that review. The constellation view it passes was retired in Ward Flow Phase 2:
> `src/app/mockups/ward-flow/constellation/page.tsx` is now a redirect-only stub to
> `/mockups/ward-flow/network` (see `docs/ward-management-mode-map.md`). The evidence paths below
> (`artifacts/ward-management/*.png` and a workstation-local generated image) are not tracked in
> this repository and cannot be opened from it. Do not treat the verdict as current.

## Fidelity review

| Surface            | Result | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Typography         | Passed | The graphite hierarchy, tabular operational figures, compact labels, and restrained microcopy preserve the reference's clinical command-centre character with stronger scanning contrast.                                                                     |
| Spacing and layout | Passed | The slim independent priority queue, central statewide network, and right-hand decision rail keep the reference's three-zone structure. The added local mode strip and role-focus band make the broader system legible without crowding the decision surface. |
| Colour and state   | Passed | Clinical blue remains the only structural accent. Green, amber, and red are reserved for capacity and exception meaning and are always reinforced by text, rank, or iconography.                                                                              |
| Assets and icons   | Passed | Existing Clinical KB branding and product iconography are used consistently. The constellation remains a schematic operational view rather than implying geographic precision.                                                                                |
| Copy and data      | Passed | Synthetic identifiers, WA service names, catchment, legal status, setting, wait, transport readiness, and capacity evidence are clear. AI is labelled as a best-fit proposal and requires an authorised human confirmation.                                   |

## Intentional improvements from the source

1. Replaced literal route-line density with four stable service clusters around a statewide coordination hub.
2. Added eight persistent Ward Flow modes so every major operational task is reachable from the same local navigation.
3. Made the priority queue independently scrollable and kept role-based ordering visible rather than hiding it behind controls.
4. Turned the shortlist into an explainable, ranked proposal with catchment, setting, availability, transport, and wait-time evidence.
5. Added a plain-language no-automatic-allocation boundary directly beside the confirmation action.
6. Kept the full constellation as a dedicated wide command view while preserving the denser command home for routine work.

## Functional and responsive evidence

- All eight Ward Flow routes were opened and checked at 1440 x 1024 with no page-level horizontal overflow.
- Flow coordinator, ED clinician, and ward coordinator role changes alter the operational focus and queue order.
- Queue selection, ranked fit review, and authorised confirmation were exercised in the browser.
- The 390 x 844 phone fallback was checked across every mode with no page-level horizontal overflow.
- Fresh browser console on the final constellation route contained no warnings or errors.
- Focused Chromium coverage includes role switching, queue collapse, all mode links, confirmation, phone layout, dark mode, forced colours, and print.

## Final review

The implementation retains the reference's visual intent and decision hierarchy while improving system navigation, privacy signalling, role clarity, and AI governance. No P0, P1, or actionable P2 fidelity issue remains.

final result: passed
