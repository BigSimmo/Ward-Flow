/**
 * gate-receipts.mjs — content-addressed memoisation for the expensive local gates.
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` has said "Do not rerun an unchanged successful gate" since the
 * process-hardening phases were written, but nothing enforced it, so the rule was
 * only ever as good as the agent's memory of what it had already run. The common
 * shape is a session that runs `npm run test`, fixes a doc, runs
 * `npm run verify:pr-local` (which runs `lint`, `typecheck` and `test` again), and
 * pays for the same full Vitest suite twice before CI pays for it a third time.
 *
 * This module removes the local half of that duplication. Before an allowlisted
 * gate runs, its wrapper computes a signature over exactly the content that gate
 * reads; if a receipt records that the same gate already exited 0 on that
 * signature, the wrapper reports the reuse and exits 0 without re-running.
 *
 * Deliberate boundaries:
 *
 * - **CI never reuses a receipt.** `receiptsEnabled()` returns false whenever `CI`
 *   is set. GitHub remains the authoritative merge gate and must re-run everything
 *   it is scoped to run; the duplication this file removes is local-only.
 * - **Receipts are never committed.** They live under `node_modules/.cache/`, so
 *   they are per-worktree, ignored by git, and destroyed by `npm ci` — which is
 *   correct, because a reinstall changes the toolchain the receipt vouched for.
 * - **Failure is never memoised.** Only a zero exit writes a receipt.
 * - **Fail open.** Any problem reading git state, or a scope that resolves to zero
 *   files, runs the gate. A bug here costs a redundant run, never a skipped one.
 * - **Artefact-producing gates are excluded.** `build` and `test:coverage` are not
 *   memoisable: their value is partly the `.next/` and `coverage/` trees they
 *   leave behind, and `check:bundle-budget` reading a stale `.next` is a known
 *   trap (see the "Bundle budget" section of `AGENTS.md`).
 *
 * A reused receipt is evidence that the gate passed on this exact content — it is
 * not evidence that it ran just now. The reuse line says so, and reports of a
 * reused gate must say "reused receipt from <time>", never "I ran it".
 *
 * CLI: `node scripts/gate-receipts.mjs [--self-test|status|clear] [gate]`

 * (a docs change leaving `lint` valid), and it buys that at the price of a false
 * skip if the scope is wrong. Both candidates for narrowing turned out to read far
 * more than they appear to: `tsconfig.typecheck.json` includes every `.ts` file
 * under the repository root with `resolveJsonModule`, so `data/` counts, and the Vitest
 * suite holds contract tests that read `.github/workflows/`, `docs/`,
 * `supabase/` and `package.json`.
 *
 * Whole-tree signatures still remove the duplication that actually costs: the same
 * gate running twice on content that did not change between the two runs, which is
 * what `verify:pr-local` followed by `verify:cheap` does to `lint`, `typecheck` and
 * the full Vitest suite today.
 *
 * A future narrowing is a declared array of path prefixes (directories end in `/`)
 * or exact paths. The self-test asserts every declared path exists and resolves to
 * a non-empty file set, so a rename cannot silently shrink a signature.
