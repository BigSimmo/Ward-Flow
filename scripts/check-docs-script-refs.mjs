/**
 * check-docs-script-refs.mjs — verify that every `npm run <script>` mentioned in
 * the maintained docs corresponds to a real script in package.json.
 *
 * check-docs-links.mjs validates file PATHS referenced in docs, but nothing checks
 * the hundreds of `npm run <script>` references — so a renamed/removed script leaves
 * stale instructions that the agents (Codex/Claude/Cursor) then follow. This closes
 * that gap.
 *
 * Only references inside inline code spans (`npm run x`) and fenced code blocks are
 * scanned, so prose like "npm run the build" is never misread. Placeholder tokens
 * (containing <…>) and an explicit allowlist are skipped.
 *
 * Scans README.md, AGENTS.md, and docs/**\/*.md excluding docs/archive, docs/audit,
 * and dated point-in-time filenames (historical records). Pass --all to include them.
 *
 * Blocking for maintained docs: runs in verify:cheap and CI. Historical directories
 * and dated point-in-time records stay excluded unless --all is requested.
