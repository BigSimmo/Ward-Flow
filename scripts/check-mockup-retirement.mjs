/**
 * check-mockup-retirement — make the written record, not a reachability scan, the gate on
 * retiring a mockup.
 *
 * Written after a 2026-09-02 survey found the mockup surface at ~430 files / ~98,000 lines
 * with three problems no existing gate could see:
 *
 *   1. `mockups/README.md` is the repo's only record of which mockup is superseded, and
 *      nothing kept it in step with the tree. It was refuted in five places by a single
 *      afternoon of evidence-gathering (the answer family, both document families, the
 *      closed issue #162, and the calculators family promoted to production by PR #1227).
 *   2. A third of the surface is not design scratch at all. `/mockups/development`,
 *      `/mockups/caring-contacts`, `/mockups/care-plan` and `/mockups/ward-flow` are live in
 *      production behind `DeveloperAreaGate` (src/proxy.ts) and linked from Settings. Any
 *      policy keyed on the path `src/app/mockups/**` hits them too.
 *   3. Filename supersession is systematically backwards. `example-round-two` IMPORTS
 *      `example-round-one`; dictionary rounds 2 and 3 both import round 1; the privacy
 *      study imports the privacy winner. Deleting "the older generation" breaks the newer one
 *      in at least five families.
 *
 * `check-dead-code-candidate.mjs` already refuses to call a SYMBOL dead on "nothing imports
 * it". This is its route-and-file-level sibling: it refuses to call a MOCKUP retired on
 * anything except a written record, and it fails CLOSED — an unanswerable question is a
 * refusal, never a pass, because proceeding on a weak signal is the exact failure mode of
 * PR #2204 (~1,644 lines, walked back seven times).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-mockup-retirement.mjs                 # audit the working tree
 *   node scripts/check-mockup-retirement.mjs --diff <base>   # audit a deletion diff
 *   node scripts/check-mockup-retirement.mjs --json
 *   node scripts/check-mockup-retirement.mjs --self-test
 *
 * Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = at least one violation. Exit 2 = bad invocation.
