/**
 * audit-merge-loss — find merged pull requests whose content was silently
 * reverted by a later merge resolution.
 *
 * Why this exists. On 2026-08-11 merge commit acf78bf ("Merge remote-tracking
 * branch origin/main into probe2-1815") took the stale branch side of several
 * manual conflict resolutions and reverted seven already-merged PRs — #1800,
 * #1803, #1804, #1809, #1811, #1815 and #1796. Nothing went red, because the
 * reverts took each PR's tests in the same stroke: no assertion survived to
 * fail. The docs casualties were repaired by 55f51ab; the source casualties
 * went unnoticed for two days. Care at the keyboard is demonstrably not the
 * control here — commit 6f8c70d shows a human consciously preserving the #1803
 * migration and a later merge in the same chain undoing it anyway.
 *
 * The measurement. For each pull request that landed on the target ref inside
 * the window, compare the ref's current tree entry for every file that landing
 * changed against that file's tree entry at the landing's first parent. Equality
 * means the landing's contribution to that file is no longer present. Tree
 * entries include the file mode and blob OID, so mode-only landings are not
 * mistaken for losses while the comparison stays cheap over a wide window.
 *
 * ADVISORY BY DESIGN — this exits 0 even when it finds something. A deliberate
 * later revert is byte-identical to an accidental one at blob level, so a
 * positive is a question for a human, not a verdict. The report names the pull
 * request, the landing commit and every affected file so that question can be
 * answered. `--strict` exits 1 for a caller that wants a hard failure.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT WIRED INTO CI OR A SCHEDULE. Running this automatically is
 * an operational change that needs its own pull request and explicit approval;
 * its absence from .github/workflows/ is a decision, not an oversight. It is
 * also not in `verify:cheap:internal`: check-gate-manifest.mjs would then
 * require a matching ci.yml step.
 *
 * Run: npm run audit:merge-loss
 *      npm run audit:merge-loss -- --since 30 --ref origin/main
 *      npm run audit:merge-loss -- --json
 *      npm run audit:merge-loss -- --strict     # exit 1 on any finding
 *      node scripts/audit-merge-loss.mjs --self-test

 * Where a landing's contribution to one file disappeared, and by what mechanism.

 * entry. That is where the contribution stopped being present; a later commit
 * that also matches is just carrying the absence forward.
 *
 * The mechanism is the triage signal, and it is the reason this tool can be read
 * at all. A merge commit dropping a side is the accidental case the audit exists
 * for. A single-parent commit is somebody choosing to remove the change, and its
 * subject almost always says why. Measured over the 2026-08-01..15 window: of 66
 * flagged non-inbox files, 14 were merge-resolution removals and 13 of those came
 * from the single documented bad merge (acf78bf) — while every one of the other 52
 * had an explanatory single-parent subject ("Re-land the --shadow-tight
 * retirement", "rework the viewer for phone and PWA reading", "ci: speed
 * iteration without weakening gates").
 *
 * This does NOT turn the audit into a verdict, and deliberately does not filter:
 * a deliberate-looking commit can still be a mistake, and `unknown` means the
 * walk found no commit matching the pre-landing entry, which is a question rather
 * than a clean bill. It orders the reading list so the accidental cases are not
 * buried under the deliberate ones.
