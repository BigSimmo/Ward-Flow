 * order, which packs the slow phone-scroll family into one shard. Explicit
 * groups mix slow-per-test and faster mega-specs so wall time is closer across
 * runners. Every production `test:e2e:pr` file must appear in exactly one group
 * — its unit test failed closed on orphans/duplicates until it was retired with
 * PsychSift's design studies on 2026-09-25.
 *
 * Do not rename specs to game alphabetical sharding. Re-measure after suite
 * growth before changing group membership.
