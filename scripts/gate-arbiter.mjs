/**
 * gate-arbiter.mjs — decide whether an expensive local gate is still worth running.
 *
 * `gate-receipts.mjs` removed the local-versus-local duplication: the same gate
 * twice on content that did not change between the two runs. It deliberately
 * cannot touch the *other* duplication, the one that costs the most and that
 * nothing measured until now:
 *
 *     run the full suite locally  ->  push  ->  GitHub runs the same suite again
 *
 * `check:gate-manifest` proves that second run always happens. Its invariant is
 * one-way — CI must never run LESS of the local static set than `verify:cheap`
 * does — so for every gate in that chain, a local run before a push is by
 * construction work GitHub is about to repeat.
 *
 * That does not make the local run waste. It is a bet: a local run that FAILS
 * saves a CI round trip, and in this repository a red or superseded push is
 * expensive (~40% of PR CI runs measured 2026-07-30 were cancellations). A local
 * run that PASSES bought nothing that the CI run would not have established.
 *
 * So the question is never "local or CI" in the abstract. It is:
 *
 *     is this gate, on this kind of change, still catching anything?
 *
 * The arbiter answers that from three inputs, none of them hard-coded, so the
 * answer moves as the repository moves:
 *
 *   1. CI coverage, derived live from `package.json` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
 *      Delete the CI job and the arbiter stops deferring to it the same day. A
 *      gate CI does not run is never deferrable: local is the only gate there is.
 *   2. Observed yield, a rolling per-gate, per-change-class window of local run
 *      outcomes, recorded automatically by the gate wrappers. A gate that has
 *      caught nothing across a full clean window on this class of change has
 *      stopped earning its runtime. The FIRST catch resets the window and the
 *      gate runs locally again — the loop re-arms itself rather than decaying.
 *   3. Content identity, so a verdict GitHub already reached on exactly this
 *      content is not re-derived locally at all.
 *
 * Deliberate boundaries, all of them the conservative direction:
 *
 * - **Fail open, always.** Missing data, unparseable CI, an unknown change class,
 *   a git failure — every one of them runs the gate. A bug here costs a redundant
 *   run, never a skipped one. That is the same contract `gate-receipts.mjs` holds.
 * - **CI is never advised by this file.** `CI` being set disables the arbiter
 *   outright. GitHub remains the authoritative merge gate; nothing computed here
 *   may influence what it decides to run.
 * - **High-risk change classes never defer**, however clean the window. Database,
 *   RAG, dependency, container, workflow and unrecognised scopes run locally.
 *   This mirrors CI's own fail-closed routing rather than inventing a second
 *   risk model.
 * - **Advisory by default.** A deferral is a recommendation printed with its
 *   evidence. The wrappers honour it only under `GATE_ARBITER=enforce`, because
 *   silently skipping a gate a human typed is precisely the failure this
 *   repository's evidence rules exist to prevent.
 * - **A deferred gate is not a passed gate.** The verdict says so in as many
 *   words, and must be reported as "deferred to CI", never as green.
 *
 * CLI:
 *   node scripts/gate-arbiter.mjs <gate>        decision + evidence for one gate
 *   node scripts/gate-arbiter.mjs status        the yield ledger, per gate/class
 *   node scripts/gate-arbiter.mjs record-ci <sha> [jobs...]
 *   node scripts/gate-arbiter.mjs clear
