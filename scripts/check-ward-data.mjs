/**
 * check:ward-data — reads the Ward Flow prototype's changeable data and says, in plain words,
 * anything that does not add up.
 *
 * WHO THIS IS FOR. The person who edits this data is a psychiatrist replacing invented bed
 * numbers with real ones, and later adding hospitals and wards as the real world changes. He is
 * not going to read a stack trace. So every message below names the file to edit, the values as
 * they are written today, the arithmetic that failed, and the choices available — never
 * "invariant violated", never a bare `expected [] to deep equal []`.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. Most of this data is checked by nothing. `Unit.sexMix` is a
 * hand-maintained pair of counts; `HealthService` is a bare type union with no runtime array, so a
 * hospital in a new service compiles clean and then silently vanishes from the network map and
 * the ED screen; `SYNTHETIC_TRAVEL_BANDS` is keyed on plain `string` site codes that nothing
 * validates; nav labels hardcode ward names that nothing compares against the ward.
 *
 * READ-ONLY AND OFFLINE. It reads source files, writes nothing, and touches no network, provider
 * or database.
 *
 * HOW IT READS THE DATA. Most facts are IMPORTED from the real TypeScript modules (re-running
 * this file under `tsx`), so the checks run against the same values the app runs against, using
 * the app's own `unitCapacity` and `bedIsOccupied` functions rather than a second copy of their
 * arithmetic. One fact cannot be imported because it is a module-local constant inside a React
 * component file, and it is read by TEXT PARSE (`columnServices` in ward-management-network.tsx).
 * A text parse can drift from the real code, so the parse FAILS LOUDLY when the shape it expects
 * is not found — it never quietly reports "nothing to check".
 *
 * Item 41 (owner-approved 2026-09-17) retired the morning bed-state tour along with the rest of
 * `src/components/ward-management/morning/`. This checker used to also text-parse
 * `TOUR_UNIT_ID`/`TOUR_ED_ID` out of morning-tour.tsx and feed them into check 7 below; that check
 * is a deliberate guard removal, not an oversight — there is no longer a tour to check.
 *
 * Run it with:  node scripts/check-ward-data.mjs
 * Exit code 0 = everything adds up. Exit code 1 = at least one problem, all of them printed.
