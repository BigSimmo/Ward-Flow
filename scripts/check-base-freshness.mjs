/**
 * check-base-freshness — advisory stale-base tripwire.
 *
 * main moves fast (claude/* branches auto-merge on green), so a worktree branched
 * a while ago can be many commits behind origin/main — which is how duplicate work
 * gets built against a stale base. This fetches origin/main and reports how far
 * behind the current branch is, warning loudly past a threshold.
 *
 * ADVISORY ONLY — never exits non-zero on staleness, so it is safe to wire into a
 * SessionStart hook or statusline without ever blocking work. Exit is non-zero
 * only on a genuine tooling error under `--strict` (off by default).
 *
 * HOOK MODE — why stdout matters. This is registered as a SessionStart hook in
 * .claude/settings.json, and Claude Code injects only a SessionStart hook's STDOUT
 * into the model's context; stderr is not injected. Every human-readable branch of
 * finish() used console.error, including the loud "N commits BEHIND origin/main"
 * warning, so the tripwire this script exists to trigger never reached the agent —
 * confirmed on a live session whose injected SessionStart context carried the sibling
 * hook's stdout lines but no `[base-freshness]` line at all, even though this hook ran
 * and exited 0. In hook mode we therefore also emit the hook JSON envelope on stdout:
 *   {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"SessionStart","additionalContext":"…"}}
 * and only when the message is worth the context it costs — the loud stale warning or
 * an error. A healthy base prints nothing at all to stdout; "ok" is not worth a token
 * in every session's preamble.
 *
 * How hook mode is detected (detected, not guessed). An explicit `--hook` flag wins.
 * Otherwise we infer it from CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR being set — Claude Code exports that
 * for hook commands specifically; it is absent from the Bash-tool environment, checked
 * directly on 2026-08-18 — together with a non-TTY stdout. `--json` is never hook mode.
 * The inference is also fail-safe rather than fail-closed: the human line still goes to
 * stderr in every mode, so a misfire on a manual run cannot break the terminal output
 * that `npm run check:base-freshness`, the `newtask` skill (step 4) and the `handoff`
 * skill read — it would only add one extra JSON line on stdout.
 *
 * The origin/main fetch is capped at 10s. Claude Code gives a hook a 60s budget, so an
 * un-timed fetch against an unreachable remote could burn the entire SessionStart
 * budget; on timeout we fall back to the last-known origin/main exactly as the offline
 * path already did.
 *
 * Env:
 *   STALE_BASE_THRESHOLD  commits-behind that triggers the loud warning (default 10)
 *   BASE_FRESHNESS_NO_FETCH=1  skip the network fetch (use last-known origin/main)
 * Flags:
 *   --json    machine-readable output
 *   --hook    force SessionStart hook output on stdout (auto-detected; see above)
 *   --strict  exit 1 when the base ref cannot be resolved (default: exit 0)
