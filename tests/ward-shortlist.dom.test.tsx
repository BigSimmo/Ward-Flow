 * ⚠️ THE OVERRIDE FORM MUST STATE WHY THE BED FAILED — WRITTEN AFTER LOOKING AT THE SCREEN,

 * reached a sighted mouse user only as a `title` tooltip on a button they cannot click, plus an
 * `sr-only` span — invisible on a touch screen, invisible by keyboard, invisible after scrolling.
 * So at the one irreversible moment, for a large class of users, the advice was not legible at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS TEST DELIBERATELY ASSERTS ON RENDERED TEXT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. A test asserting
 * the reason string is merely "present" passes on a `title` attribute nobody on a touchscreen can
 * reach — so it would certify the exact defect it was written to prevent. Ward Verifier made that
 * argument, and it is why both cases below were opened in a real browser at `http://localhost:4215`
 * BEFORE this file was written. What was seen:
 *   - `WF-009` (referable stage, candidate already declined) -> "Ward 2K — Not eligible:
 *     Already declined this movement"
 *   - `WF-011` (bed pulled, every candidate eligible) -> "WF-011 cannot be referred while it is bed
 *     pulled — referral is only available while placement is requested or a destination is under
 *     review."
 *
 * ⚠️ AND TWO CASES, BECAUSE ONE OF THEM WAS MISSED THE FIRST TIME. Refer has two independent
 * blockers — an ineligible ward, and a non-referable stage — and `canOverride` carries neither
 * guard, so both reach this form. The first version of the fix keyed on the ineligible ward alone,
