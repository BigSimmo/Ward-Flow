/**
 * THE WHOLE WARD TREE'S PRINT CORRECTNESS RESTS ON ONE COMPOSES EDGE, AND NOTHING PINNED IT.
 *
 * Measured in Chromium 151 on 2026-09-04, under `emulateMedia({ media: "print",
 * colorScheme: "dark" })`, with the reset present ONLY on an ancestor two levels up and the
 * descendant screen composing nothing and carrying no print block of its own:
 *
 *     screen media (control)   tour bg rgb(23,26,29)   caption rgb(244,246,248)   cell rgb(244,246,248)
 *     print media              tour bg rgb(255,255,255) caption rgb(0,0,0)        cell rgb(0,0,0)
 *
 * The chain that produces that, every link read rather than recalled:
 *
 *   1. `src/app/mockups/ward-flow/layout.tsx` wraps `children` — the whole of every route's own
 *      output — in `<WardGround>`. It is the ONLY layout under the ward-flow route tree, so every
 *      ward route is inside it.
 *   2. `WardGround` renders `<div className={styles.shell}>{children}</div>`.
 *   3. `.shell` in `ward-shell.module.css` does `composes: wardTokens from "./ward-tokens.module.css"`,
 *      so the compiled element carries BOTH class names.
 *   4. `ward-tokens.module.css` carries `@media print { .wardTokens, .wardTokens * { … !important } }`.
 *
 * `.wardTokens *` therefore matches every element of every ward route's IN-FLOW content, and
 * `!important` beats a colour or background the element declares on itself — which is the one thing
 * an ordinary ancestor rule cannot do, and the reason the per-screen fixes were needed before this
 * edge existed.
 *
 * ⚠️ IN-FLOW IS LOAD-BEARING IN THAT SENTENCE, AND AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS COMMENT OMITTED IT.
 * `.wardTokens *` reaches DOM descendants only, and one ward surface is not a DOM descendant of the
 * shell: `ward-management-navigation.tsx` renders the phone drawer through `<Sheet>`, which renders
 * through `OverlayPortal` (`@/components/ui/overlay-root`). Portalled content leaves the shell's
 * subtree entirely, so `.drawerBody` and everything inside it is NOT covered by this chain.
 *
 * That is why `ward-sidebar.module.css`'s own three-root print block — `.panel`, `.drawerBody`,
 * `.phoneBar`, each with its wildcard — is LOAD-BEARING rather than belt-and-braces, and must not be
 * removed as redundant on the strength of the chain below.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND NOTE HOW THE WRONG ANSWER WAS NEARLY REACHED, TWICE. A grep for `createPortal` across
 * `src/components/ward-management/**` returns nothing — the portal is two files away, in a shared
 * `Sheet`. And an import-graph traversal correctly reports that no ward component is reachable from
 * a non-ward route, which is a fact about REACHABILITY and says nothing about DOM CONTAINMENT. Both
 * instruments were sound; both answered a narrower question than the one being asked.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `ward-management-print-coverage.test.ts`. That guard asks
 * a PER-FILE question: does this stylesheet carry, or compose, a reset that wins? It would notice
 * the central reset being deleted, because every composing file would go uncovered at once. It
 * would NOT notice link 1, 2 or 3 breaking, because each stylesheet's own text is unchanged — the
 * files keep their own belt-and-braces blocks and stay individually green while the tree silently
 * loses the blanket that covers anything WITHOUT one. A future screen added with no print block is
 * correct on the day it is added because of this chain, and nothing else would say so.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS PROVED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, WHICH MUTATION TESTING ALONE DOES NOT GIVE YOU. Every
 * mutation run on this programme had the shape "make the code wrong, watch it go red". Both defects
 * actually found in these guards were the other direction — a guard going red on CORRECT code —
 * and that is the more dangerous half, because the natural repair is to change the working code
 * until the guard is satisfied. So each assertion below accepts every spelling that is equivalent
 * in EFFECT, and the "accepts correct variants" block proves it does.

/**
 * ⚠️ THE PORTAL SURFACE IS A CLOSED SET OF ONE, AND NOTHING PINNED IT.

 * The chain above covers in-flow content. Portalled content leaves the shell's subtree, so the ONLY

 *
 *     ward-management-navigation.tsx  ->  @/components/ui/sheet  ->  overlay-root (createPortal)
 *
 * and `ward-sidebar.module.css` covers its content with `.drawerBody, .drawerBody *`.
 *
 * The hazard is a SECOND portal. Add a sheet, dialog or overlay to any ward screen and its content
 * silently leaves the shell — the central reset stops reaching it, every existing guard stays green,
 * and the page prints near-white on white paper in dark mode. Nothing in the diff says so, because
 * the diff is a component change and the defect is in the DOM.
 *
 * So this pins the SET, two-sided: a new portal-importing file goes red and is told what to do; a
 * file that stops portalling must be removed from the list rather than left as permanent amnesty.
 *
 * ⚠️ A RED HERE IS A DECISION REQUIRED, NOT A DEFECT. The repair is never "remove the Sheet". It is
 * "give the portalled content its own print reset, then add the file here" — the same shape as
 * `ward-sidebar`'s three-root block, which exists for exactly this reason and is load-bearing.
 *
 * Detection resolves imports two hops deep rather than matching names: a module counts as portalling
 * if it calls `createPortal`, or imports a module under `src/components/ui/` that does. Matching the
 * NAME would be defeated the way `<SheetPerson` and `<SheetGroup` in `board/ward-daily-sheet.tsx`
 * already defeat it — a file whose whole vocabulary is the word "sheet" and which imports no Sheet
