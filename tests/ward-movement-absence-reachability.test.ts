/**
 * REACHABILITY, DRIVEN — never read.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE TWO OF MY OWN "IMPOSSIBLE STATE" CLAIMS WERE WRONG IN ONE NIGHT,
 * AND BOTH WERE WRONG THE SAME WAY: I READ A REJECTION GUARD AND CONCLUDED WHAT COULD NOT EXIST.**
 *
 *   - I claimed 17 of 30 generated movements were impossible because `ACCEPT_IN_PRINCIPLE` rejects
 *     unless `referredUnitIds.includes(event.unitId)`. The same update sets `referredUnitIds: []`.
 *     The guard is a PRECONDITION CONSUMED BY THE TRANSITION, not an invariant that survives it.
 *   - I claimed "flagged urgent AND closed" was unreachable because `FLAG_MOVEMENT_URGENT` refuses
 *     a closed movement. Nothing refuses the other ORDER, and the closure spreads the flag through.
 *
 * The rule those two produce: **a guard tells you what is checked, never what survives the update.**
 * So every claim here is settled by dispatching real events at real seeded state and looking at what
 * comes out — not by reading the reducer, which is exactly what produced both errors.
 *
 * ⚠️ A test that only asserted the UNREACHABLE half would be the same mistake in test form: it can
 * pass because the state is genuinely impossible, or because the transitions were never attempted.
 * The REACHABLE half is the control — it proves this file can actually drive the reducer.
