//
// THE THIRD TRANSPORT STATE — owner ruling R-2026-09-04-C.
//
// Before this, `Movement.transport` was the only thing the model held about transport, and its
// absence meant two opposite operational situations at once: NO TRANSPORT IS NEEDED (finished) and
// NO TRANSPORT HAS BEEN BOOKED (outstanding). A screen could honestly say no more than "no
// transport recorded" for either. `Movement.transportNeed` is the recorded answer, shaped exactly
// like `Referral.medicalClearance`, and `transportNeedState` names all three so a caller cannot
// collapse two of them with `?? false`.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THE FIXTURE IS ASSERTED TO CARRY NOTHING, AND WHY THAT IS THE TEST RATHER THAN A GAP.
// The ruling requires "not recorded" to remain the default for existing data: a backfill that
// guessed one of the other two for a legacy movement would manufacture the very certainty the
// third state exists to provide honestly. Every seeded and generated movement is existing data, so
// the fixture answers for none of them — and the reducer tests below are what stop that absence
// from meaning the field simply does not work.
