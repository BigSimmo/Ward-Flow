/**
 * THE ELEVATED PANEL ON THE DISCHARGES BOARD MARKS WORK, NOT A HEADING.
 *
 * The four groups render in a fixed scan order — blocked first, because those are the rows
 * somebody must act on — and until 2026-09-05 nothing but that order said so: measured at 1100px,
 * all four sections painted `rgb(251, 252, 253)` behind the same border, so the stuck releases and
 * the beds already free were the same object four times over.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE LIFT IS CONDITIONAL ON THERE BEING ROWS, WHICH IS THE HALF THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR.**
 * Raising the Blocked heading unconditionally would make an EMPTY panel the loudest thing on a
 * board where nothing is stuck — an absence promoted to a headline, and the good morning would
 * look like the urgent one. The property is "there is work here", never "this heading matters".
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE EMPTY ARM IS UNREACHABLE THROUGH `DischargeBoard`.** The seeded state always contains
 * blocked releases, so a guard written only against the whole board would assert something true
 * and unfalsifiable — green today, green after somebody makes the lift unconditional, and red only
 * on a fixture nobody has. That is why `DischargeGroupSection` is exported and rendered directly
 * here with an empty list.
