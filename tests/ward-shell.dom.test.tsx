// tests/ward-shell.dom.test.tsx
//
// Tasks 1 and 2 of docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-04-ward-flow-navigation-shell.md, combined
// into one file per the implementer brief (the two tasks share `ward-shell.tsx` and
// `ward-shell.module.css`, so their assertions are kept together rather than split across the
// two files the plan names — `tests/ward-shell-ground.test.ts` and
// `tests/ward-shell-header.dom.test.tsx`).
//
// Updated 2026-09-04 for the ruling that split `ward-shell.tsx` into two components:
// `WardGround` (the ground alone, mounted in `src/app/mockups/ward-flow/layout.tsx`, the only
// thing that is an ancestor of every route's `<main>`) and `WardShellHeader` (the place label
// alone, no props, deriving its own place from `usePathname` — never a role switcher, since
// `ClinicalRail` already renders one). See `tests/ward-shell-mounted.test.tsx` for proof the
// split is actually wired together at the real mount point.

     * ⚠️ **A STICKY OCCLUDER IS EXEMPT, AND THE EXEMPTION IS NARROW ON PURPOSE (2026-09-05).** A bar
     * pinned over scrolling content has to repaint the ground it sits on, or the rows pass through
     * it. That is not a second OWNER of the page ground — it is the same value being re-laid over
     * itself — and the alternative was worse in both directions: hard-coding `var(--surface)` in the
     * sticky rule silently un-tracks the ground the day it changes again, and dropping this guard
     * loses the drift it exists to catch.
     *
     * **So the rule must ALSO declare `position: sticky`.** A plain panel or card reaching for the
     * ground still fails here, which is the case that actually goes wrong.
     *
     * ⚠️ **A SECOND CHAT NARROWED THIS SAME ASSERTION TONIGHT TO PAGE-LEVEL SELECTORS —
     * `.screen|.shell|.page|.root` — AND THIS VERSION IS THE BETTER ONE, WHICH IS WHY IT WON.** That
     * one matched on the CLASS NAME, so a page-level container called `.wrap` or `.board` escaped it
     * entirely: a detector defeated by a rename. **This one computes the exemption from the rule's own
     * declaration, which cannot be renamed around.** It also fixed the two offending chips
     * (`.kbdHint` and `.familyCard` now take `var(--surface)`) instead of widening the guard to
     * tolerate them — a smaller exemption AND fewer things exempted.
     *
     * ⚠️ **WHY A NON-STICKY GROUND PAINT IS DANGEROUS AT ALL, carried across from that other
     * narrowing because it is the justification this exemption rests on and was measured:** a
     * dark-theme `--ward-ground` survives into print, because the dark palette is scoped by a CLASS on
     * `<html>` and not by a media query. A card painted with it would print dark while the screen's
     * print reset forces text to `CanvasText` — black ink on a dark card. `community-index`'s print
     * block already declares `background-color: Canvas !important` on `.screen` and `.screen *`, which
     * is what makes the sticky exemption safe rather than merely convenient. **A screen that paints
     * the ground WITHOUT such a reset is the real defect, and it still fails here.**
