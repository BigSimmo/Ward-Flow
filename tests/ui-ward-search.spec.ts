/**
 * FIRST BROWSER COVERAGE OF THE WARD FLOW PATIENT SEARCH (`/mockups/ward-flow/search`).
 *
 * Until this file, `PatientTypeahead` and `PatientSearchPage` had only jsdom coverage
 * (`tests/ward-patient-typeahead.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/ward-patient-search.dom.test.tsx`). jsdom
 * computes NO layout and loads NO CSS Modules stylesheet, so every assertion below is checking a
 * class of defect no existing test could ever have seen: a column escaping its scroll container,
 * a popup row scrolled out of its own clipped box, a hit target shorter than its container, two
 * visual states that read as one because two selectors were merged. None of that is expressible
 * without a real rendered box.
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURE MATTERS: the seeded patient list (`ward-patients-seed.ts`) deliberately carries
 * three near-spelling pairs — Halloway/Hallowin, Marrowby/Marrowbee, O'Quinn/Oquinn — that cannot
 * be told apart by name alone. The two facts that DO tell them apart, record number (`umrn`) and
 * date of birth, are exactly what test 2 below proves stays on screen for both rows of a matching
 * pair at the narrowest supported width. Wrong-patient selection on this screen is the harm this
 * whole component was built to prevent (see `patient-typeahead.tsx`'s own doc comment), and that
 * harm lives entirely in geometry a unit test cannot see.
 *
 * FIXTURE ARITHMETIC USED THROUGHOUT, verified against `ward-patients-seed.ts` directly (not
 * assumed) and cross-checked live in a browser before this file was written:
 *   - "marrowb" matches EXACTLY Ines Marrowby (PT-003) and Devan Marrowbee (PT-004) — both
 *     `familyName.startsWith("marrowb")` — and nobody else. (It was "marrow" until 25 Sept 2026,
 *     when the seed grew past eight patients and PT-013 Gianna Marrowvale also matched.)
 *   - "a" matches all eight seeded patients (every one of their `Given Family` display names
 *     contains the letter "a"), in fixture order: PT-001..PT-008. So this text query is what
 *     tests 3 and 4 use whenever the property under test needs a keyboard cursor to move through
 *     more than two options.
 *   - "wf" matches every open movement's `id` field (every seeded movement id is shaped
 *     `WF-###`), which is what test 1 uses to guarantee the results table actually renders rows
 *     to measure rather than the empty-state panel.
 *
 * `data-ward-primitive="table"` (not a page-specific testid) is what selects the results table's
 * scroll wrapper below: `ResultsSection` mounts the shared `WardTable` primitive with no `testId`
 * prop of its own, so the primitive's own attribute — already the documented, production-safe
 * selector `tests/ui-ward-forced-colors.spec.ts`'s own header explains — is the only stable hook.

   * 1. WIDTH SWEEP. Two widths at the extremes are not a sweep (Ward Builder Three's contract,
   * adopted today) — the band in between is where a layout hands over from one arrangement to
   * another, and that is where damage happens. Five widths: 375 (phone), 641/700/760 (the band
   * between the phone bar and the icon rail — `search.module.css`'s own `@media (max-width: 40rem)`
   * breakpoint sits at 640px), and 820 (just past the band).
   *
   * Two properties, both geometric and both impossible in jsdom:
   *   - every cell of the results table lies within its scroll wrapper's own SCROLLABLE extent, so
   *     a reader can reach it. Sideways scrolling to see a column is expected on a table pinned
   *     wider than a phone and is not a defect; a column no scroll can reach is;
   *   - the page's own `<html>` never gains horizontal scroll at any of the five widths.
   *
   * ⚠️ THE FIRST PROPERTY WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN AS "no cell outside the wrapper's VISIBLE right
   * edge", copied from `ui-ward-discharges.spec.ts`. That is unsatisfiable for a table that
   * scrolls — see the long note at the assertion — and it was the test that was wrong, not the
   * page. Corrected under the owner's 2026-09-05 standing rule that testing must work with a
   * redesign rather than fight it: **guard the property, never the layout that happens to satisfy
   * it today.**
   *
   * PREDICTED FAILURE for the corrected form: a cell placed outside the scroll extent — e.g. an
   * absolutely positioned descendant escaping the scroll box, which is precisely the defect the
   * second property caught (a `.sr-only` header label with no positioned ancestor put 324px of
   * horizontal scroll on `<html>` itself). Both halves therefore have a demonstrated failure,
   * and the second one's was a live defect rather than a synthetic break.

   * `search/patient-typeahead.module.css` now carries exactly the prescribed pair —
   * `align-self: stretch` with `min-height: var(--ward-tap)` — on both the input and its sibling,
   * and the stylesheet's own comment names the absent-declaration defect it closes.
   *
   * ⚠️ **TREAT THIS SPEC'S STATUS AS UNKNOWN RATHER THAN RED OR GREEN, and that is the point worth

   * green anywhere to correct them. **Re-read this comment the first time the lane is switched on**
   * — the flag is `vars.WARD_JOURNEYS_BLOCKING`, unset by default.
   *
   * ⚠️ **AND THE DEFECT ITSELF IS THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT IN THIS REPOSITORY FOR KEEPING THESE
