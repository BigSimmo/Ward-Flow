/**
 * THE BLOCKER COLUMN BELONGS TO THE BLOCKED GROUP AND NOWHERE ELSE. `Stage` BELONGS EVERYWHERE.
 *
 * Ward Lead ruling E16, 2026-09-05. `groupDischarges` routes every release with a non-null blocker
 * into `blocked`, so in the other three groups `release.blocker` is `null` BY CONSTRUCTION and the
 * cell read "Not applicable" on every row — seven times on the seeded board, a sixth of the table
 * spent on a fact about the column rather than about the patient. The card list for this same
 * board has always rendered `{release.blocker && …}` and omitted it; the table restated it. **Two
 * renderings of one board disagreeing about whether an absence is worth stating is a defect, and
 * the deliberate one wins over the repeated one.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **`Stage` IS CONSTANT IN THREE GROUPS TOO AND IS DELIBERATELY KEPT.** It is a genuine per-row
 * fact, and keeping it everywhere makes the Blocked group's Stage the only VARYING one on the
 * page, which puts the emphasis where this board exists to put it. The last test below pins the
 * structural reason that is true — the blocked bucket is the only one whose membership test does
 * not fix `state` — rather than pinning what today's fixture happens to show.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE FIRST READING OF THIS SAID SIX REDUNDANT COLUMNS, NOT TWO.** Measured off the
 * rendered table, `discharged-today` showed all six as constant, because it has ONE seeded row.
 * A rendered table cannot tell a column that is constant by construction from one that is constant
 * because the group is small; acting on that reading would have deleted four columns carrying real
 * per-row facts from a clinical board.
 */

/*
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT COVER, ESTABLISHED BY DELIBERATELY MUTATING WHERE I EXPECTED NO
 * COVERAGE — Ward Lead's point that a mutation run with no surprises has told you nothing.
 *
 * **It pins the header list and forbids one string. It says NOTHING about which cell sits under
 * which header.** Two mutations swapped adjacent `<td>`s while leaving the `<thead>` untouched —
 * Stage against Blocker, and Health service against Expected — and this file stayed green through
 * both. A value under the wrong heading is a nastier defect than a wrong header list, and it is
 * outside this suite's reach by construction.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND BOTH MUTATIONS WERE STILL CAUGHT — BY OLDER TESTS THAT READ CELLS POSITIONALLY FOR
 * UNRELATED REASONS.** `ward-discharge-board.dom.test.tsx` caught the first with *"states each
 * blocked row's own stage"* (it read `Awaiting accommodation` where a stage belonged), and a
 * release-band test caught the second (`East Metro` where `By midday` belonged). I predicted
 * SURVIVED for both and was wrong twice.
 *
 * **That coverage is real, incidental and undocumented.** It exists because three separate tests
 * happen to read three different columns by index for their own purposes. Nothing names it, and
 * a refactor of those tests to look cells up by header — an obvious tidy-up — would remove it
 * silently while every one of them stayed green. If cell-to-header correspondence is wanted as a
 * property rather than as a by-product, it needs its own assertion here; this note is so that
 * whoever needs it does not read this file's name and assume it is already covered.
