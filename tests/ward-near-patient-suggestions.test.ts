// `nearPatients` — the matcher behind "did you mean?" on the patient front door.
//
// ⚠️ THE HARM THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT IS NOT A FAILED SEARCH. A clinician who searches a misspelling,
// is told "nobody of that name is known", and presses the button the screen offers has created a
// SECOND RECORD for a person already in the system — two medication histories, two risk records,
// and a bed found for somebody the system already knows. A duplicate is worse than friction.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE OPPOSITE FAILURE IS WORSE STILL: a suggestion that surfaces the WRONG person, accepted,
// attaches a referral to somebody else. A duplicate is visible; a misattribution is not. That is why
// the rule is one keystroke rather than a similarity score, and why nothing here ranks.
