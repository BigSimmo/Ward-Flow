/**
 * A health service cannot go missing from the screens that group by it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner intends to replace this invented network with real WA figures and,
 * in his words, to allow "real parts changing in real life as well ... i.e. building another
 * hospital or more beds". A hospital in a SIXTH health service was, until 2026-08-29, a silent
 * data loss: `HealthService` was a bare type union with no runtime array — the only multi-value
 * union in `ward-model.ts` without one — the five services were re-typed by hand in
 * `wardServiceOrder`, and `ward-management-network.tsx` tested membership through a
 * `readonly string[]` cast that defeated the compiler too. Add the sixth and it compiled clean,
 * then simply was not on the network map or the ED screen's unit table. No error, no red test.
 *
 * `ward-model.ts`'s own `COHORTS` comment records the same defect having already happened once
 * with `Cohort`, which is why this is a repeat rather than a hypothetical.
 *
 * WHY ONE ASSERTION IS ENOUGH, and this is the part worth reading before adding more. Every
 * surface that groups by health service derives its list from `wardServiceOrder` rather than
 * holding its own — verified when this was written, and pinned by the second test below:
 *
 *   ed/ed-screen.tsx                  `wardServiceOrder.flatMap(...)` builds the unit table
 *   ward-management-network.tsx       `columnServices.right` is `wardServiceOrder.filter(...)`
 *   coordinator/flow-diagram.tsx      groups by `wardServiceOrder`
 *   wards/ward-index.tsx              headings run in `wardServiceOrder`
 *
 * So a service present in `HEALTH_SERVICES` and absent from `wardServiceOrder` is invisible on all
 * four, and a service present in both is visible on all four. The completeness of that ONE list is
 * the whole property.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. It does not check which COLUMN a service lands in on the network map —
 * `LEFT_COLUMN_SERVICES` decides that, and a service missing from it still appears, on the right.
 * Placement is a presentation choice; presence is the safety property. Stated so the next reader
 * knows the gap is deliberate rather than overlooked.
 */

/** The four surfaces that group by health service. Each must derive from `wardServiceOrder` rather
 *  than hold its own copy — that is what makes the single completeness assertion above sufficient
 *  for all of them, and re-typing a list here is exactly how the original hole was dug. */
