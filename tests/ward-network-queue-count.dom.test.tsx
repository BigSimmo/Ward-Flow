/**
 * A QUEUE FOR PLACEMENT COUNTS PEOPLE STILL WAITING FOR A PLACE.
 *
 * The network page's "Priority queue" panel rendered `movements.length` — every movement ever, with
 * arrived and closed patients counted among people waiting for a bed. The list under it did the
 * same, rendering arrived patients as rows in a queue for placement.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The correct number was computed in the same component, thirty-three lines earlier**, under a
 * comment saying in terms that the raw count "includes them and overstates live demand" — and then
 * shown only in a detail line that appears when a patient is selected. The component knew, said so,
 * and rendered the other number anyway.
 *
 * Phase 1's audit recorded this exact shape once already: "48 open movements counted six arrived and
 * one closed record". Same defect, different component, and no test caught either.
 *
 * Three screens disagreed on screen — transport said 43 open, search showed 43 movements, the
 * network said 50 — and the network is the one a coordinator looks at first.
