/**
 * 🔴 **WARDS AND DEPARTMENTS DO NOT SHARE A MEASURE SET, AND ONE TABLE WOULD CLAIM THEY DO.**
 *
 * The section's own description promised "the same measure set beside every ward and emergency
 * department". That sentence is false of the software, not merely ambitious: a ward measure is
 * about BEDS — length of stay, empty-bed minutes, discharge dates — and an emergency department in
 * this model has no beds, no capacity and no occupancy. `statistics-ed-screen.tsx` already says so
 * in its own words: **"A WARD AND AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ARE NOT ONE LIST WITH A FLAG."**
 *
 * The compare stub carried the test both sides must pass, and both do:
 *
 * > A measure can be set against a named ward only when the record it comes from carries a
 * > REQUIRED unit id. … An `Admission` carries `unitId` and always has one, so anything derived
 * > from admissions attributes cleanly. A unit id that is optional attributes only to the part of
 * > the population where it happens to be set — which is never the whole column, and never the
 * > part a reader assumes.
 *
 * Ward figures attribute through `Admission.unitId`; department figures through
 * `Movement.originEdId`. Both are required. **They attribute cleanly and they attribute from
 * different records, which is precisely why they cannot share a table.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE DEFECT THIS FORBIDS IS A BLANK CELL, NOT A MISSING TABLE.** One table with a ward's
 * columns and a department's rows leaves half the grid empty, and **a blank cell in a comparison
 * reads as a measured zero** — the same failure as a null average rendered as `0`, wearing a
 * different hat. A reader cannot tell "not measured here" from "measured, and it was none".

   *   38rem    measured against five columns  -> row headers were allowed to wrap

   *   40rem    measured against five columns, headers wrapping  <- 2026-09-12, and NOT a shape change
   *
   * **Neither reading was wrong when it was taken.** Removing a column did not make the measurement
   * incorrect; it made it a measurement of a DIFFERENT TABLE. That is the part that generalises past
   * pins: **a measurement's subject can change without the measurement changing, and nothing
   * announces it.**
   *
   * ⚠️ **AN OVER-PIN IS NOT A MILDER INERT PIN. IT IS WORSE, AND IT HIDES IN THE SAME THREE PLACES.**
   * An inert pin does nothing; an over-pin actively forces a horizontal scroll that was not required
   * and pushes columns off a scroller they would have fitted — manufacturing the very defect a pin
   * exists to prevent, while the stylesheet reads deliberate, the pin map reads measured, and the
   * page looks perfect at desk width.
   *
   * ✅ **2026-09-12 — THE FIRST TIME THIS GUARD WENT RED, AND IT WAS RIGHT TO.** `9a4f4105f0` moved the
   * pin 35rem -> 40rem with the column count unchanged, which is precisely the shape this `it.each`
   * exists to stop. It went red naming both facts. The commit that moved it claimed a fresh
   * measurement AND, elsewhere in the same message, said the browser probe could not be executed —
   * so the number was not traceable to a run, which is the only thing that can justify moving it.
   *
   * **It was therefore RE-MEASURED in a browser before this line was touched, not after.** Chromium,
   * the running dev server, 1440x900, `min-width` cleared to `0px` and PROVEN cleared (`0px` read
   * back) so the frozen-transition corruption documented in `ui-ward-table-thresholds.spec.ts` could
   * not floor the result:
   *
   *     min-content  562.88px      (35rem = 560px sat 2.88px BELOW it — the old pin really was inert)
   *     max-content  632.69px      (40rem = 640px sits 7.31px above it — the stated design intent)
   *     columns      5             (unchanged, so this is a value change and nothing else)
   *
   * ⚠️ **AND THE OVER-PIN COST WAS MEASURED TOO RATHER THAN WAVED AWAY, BECAUSE THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE
   * SAYS AN OVER-PIN IS THE WORSE FAULT.** At a 700px viewport the scroller is 626px and the pin
   * forces 640px — 14px of horizontal overflow. But the table's own max-content (632.69px) would have
   * overflowed that same scroller by ~7px unaided, so the pin does not manufacture the scroll there.
   * The band where it manufactures one from nothing is scroller widths in [632.69, 640) — **seven
   * pixels wide**. That is the honest cost of restoring the never-compress intent, and it is recorded
   * here so the next person weighs it rather than rediscovering it.
   *
   * So the two facts are read from where they actually live — the pin from the stylesheet, the
   * column count from the render — and both are checked against what was recorded when the
   * measurement was taken. **Change either without re-measuring and this goes red naming both.**
