/**
 * Spec D15 / the fourth most important test: matching must stay independent of the bed-release
 * model — three stages plus a blocked flag since the rework of 2026-08-28, a waiting-on axis in
 * place of `likely`/`possible` since the Q1 change of the same date, and still unvalidated
 * by any ward clinician. The contract is unchanged by that rework, and deliberately so: the
 * whole point of D15 is that matching does not care what shape the release model is today. A source-text contract rather
 * than a runtime assertion, because the whole point is that no code path reachable from matching
 * reads that model AT ALL — not even one that happens to agree with `unit.allocatable` today.
 *
 * H1 fix (this test was hollow): the identifier pattern used to check only the bare `BedRelease`,
 * `BED_RELEASE_STATES` and the confidence spellings that preceded `BED_RELEASE_WAITING_ON` — `\bBedRelease\b` requires
 * a word boundary immediately after "BedRelease", so `BedReleaseState`, `BedReleaseWaitingOn`,
 * `releaseBand`/`RELEASE_BANDS` and `capacityBreakdown` (which takes `BedRelease[]`) all survived
 * it untouched. The pattern below enumerates every spelling that actually names a piece of the
 * release model, EXACTLY — not a `\bBedRelease\w*\b` wildcard, which would also catch
 * `BedReleaseBlocker`/`BED_RELEASE_BLOCKERS` (`ward-change-reasons.ts`, imported by
 * `ward-model.ts`, which every referral/unit type comes from): a real, necessary, unrelated
 * import that has nothing to do with the release model matching must avoid. Confirmed with
 * `node -e` in isolation before use, not asserted.
 *
 * The two hand-listed file paths were the second hollow half: a third file added to the import
 * chain between `ward-eligibility.ts`/`ward-referrals.ts` and the model it reads was invisible to
 * a test that only ever opened those two exact paths. `collectModuleGraph` below instead starts
 * at those two entry points — legitimately named, since they ARE the matching implementation —
 * and follows every local (`@/…` or `./…`) import transitively, so a new file introduced anywhere
 * in that chain is checked automatically rather than needing to be added to a list by hand.
 *
 * Checked against `import` statements specifically (not the whole file) so this test does not
 * collide with a doc comment that names `BedRelease` in prose, the way the naive whole-file
 * check first written here did — that version failed on this file's OWN explanatory comment
 * about staying independent of the release model, which is exactly the false positive a
 * structural test must not produce.

  // semicolon it meets: a semicolon inside a comment in the middle of an import truncates the
  // "statement" before the module specifier is ever reached. Measured, not assumed — the line
  //     import { /* note; hidden */ SYNTHETIC_TRAVEL_BANDS } from "@/.../ward-travel-bands";
  // yielded exactly `import { /* note;`, which names neither the specifier nor the import.
  //
  // That defeated this contract TWO ways at once, which is why it mattered here more than
  // anywhere else it appears: a bed-release import could hide from the identifier check below,
  // AND `collectModuleGraph` would stop following it — so the graph would narrow silently while
  // the test still reported green. That is the "check that cannot fail" shape at the one place
  // this phase can least afford it.
  //
  // CORRECTED fix round 5 — the claim that stood here was false, and a false reassurance in a
  // comment is how this codebase acquired an invented Mental Health Act figure. It read
  // "stripping first can only ever reveal MORE imports, never fewer, so it strictly strengthens
  // every assertion built on it". The second half is the safe part and remains true; the first
  // half was not. A scanner that loses track of where it is reveals FEWER imports, not more: a
  // regex literal containing a quote character used to flip it into string mode permanently, and
  // every line after that went unscanned. Measured over every file under `src`, that blinded nine
  // files, one for its last 65 lines. Imports sit above the offending regex in all nine, so no
  // import was actually lost and this contract was sound in practice — but it was sound by
  // accident of file layout, not by construction, and the comment claimed otherwise.
  //
  // What is true now, and why: the scanner TRACKS regex literals rather than stripping them, and
  // resynchronises at a newline inside a quoted string or a regex, since neither may contain one.
  // Where it still cannot be sure, it reports `balanced: false` and the sweep fails loudly rather
  // than reporting clean over a partial read. Nothing else in this contract changed: the
  // identifier list, the entry points, the non-vacuity floor and every assertion are as they were.

   * literal word `import`, and nothing else. So
   * `export { BedRelease } from "./ward-model";` was **invisible to it**.
   *
   * `tests/ward-referral-screen-boundary.test.ts` (FD-23) had the identical hole, written by a
   * different hand, and it was fixed hours before this one. **Two guards failing on the same
   * statement form is not two bugs — it is one wrong assumption about what an import looks like,
   * made twice.** A grep for `match(/import` across `tests/` and `scripts/` found exactly three
   * hits: FD-23's (fixed), this one, and `ward-travel-grouping.test.ts:889` — which is **not** a
   * third instance, because it inspects one hand-written sample inside its own self-test and never
   * scans real source. The `/g` is the tell: the guards sweep files, that one does not.
   *
   * ⚠️ **AND THE BLAST RADIUS IS NOT ONLY THE VOCABULARY CHECK.** This is used twice — by
   * `importsMention` below, and by the graph walk further down that decides **which files get
   * swept at all**. A module reachable ONLY by a re-export was never visited, so nothing inside it
   * was scanned either. That defeats this guard's own defence against reaching a forbidden name
   * through an intermediate module, one level above where anyone was looking.
   *
   * ⚠️ **THE FALSE POSITIVE THIS MUST NOT CREATE:** `export const x = 1;` has **no `from` clause**
   * and is not a module edge. A widened regex that reddens honest code trades a silent hole for a
   * loud one, so the `from` is required and the case is pinned below.
   *
   * Renamed because `importStatementsOf` had become a lie about what it returns — a name that
   * describes what a function used to do is a false claim, not merely stale, and the type checker
