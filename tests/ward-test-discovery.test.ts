/**
 * The problem this closes: every "full ward suite" figure has been derived from the FILENAME
 * PREFIX `tests/ward-*`, which is a naming convention nobody enforces, not a discovery rule.
 * `tests/pressure-strip.dom.test.tsx` and `tests/tracker-derivations.test.ts` both statically
 * import from `src/components/ward-management/` and are named after the component/module under
 * test -- the more natural convention -- which makes them invisible to any count or floor built
 * on the `ward-*` prefix.
 *
 * Scope: this walks `tests/**\/*.test.ts` and `tests/**\/*.dom.test.tsx`, i.e. exactly the two
 * populations vitest.config.mts collects for the node and jsdom projects. `tests/ui-*.spec.ts`
 * Playwright journeys are a separate runner and population and are deliberately out of scope.
 *
 * The distinction that makes this correct, and it was measured: IMPORTS, not MENTIONS.
 * `tests/dependency-drift-check.test.ts` and `tests/viewport-fill-contract.test.ts` both name
 * `src/components/ward-management` as a string (a path fixture / contract assertion) with zero
 * imports -- they are not ward guards and must not be flagged.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE SAME-SHAPED PHRASE IN THE OTHER RULE DRAWS THE OPPOSITE LINE.** The ward suite
 * POPULATION rule -- the one that yields 273 files, published in
 * `docs/ward-flow/NEW-CHAT-PROMPTS-2026-09-05.md` -- says "EXECUTABLE, not MENTION", where a
 * comment is what does not count and an executable STRING does. This file says "IMPORTS, not
 * MENTIONS", where a string does not count at all. `dependency-drift-check.test.ts` is the worked
 * example sitting in both: excluded here, included there, correctly by each. The two rules answer
 * different questions -- *"is this file named honestly for what it imports?"* versus *"must this
 * file run to know Ward Flow is healthy?"* -- so neither is a definition of the other, and a
 * reader who carries the phrase across from one to the other gets it exactly backwards.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE COUNTS BELOW ARE A DATED SNAPSHOT AND NOTHING ENFORCES THEM. DO NOT CITE THEM AS
 * AUTHORITY.** Measured 2026-09-05 at master-line tip `ae41ca860`: 121 node + 106 jsdom = **227
 * ward-management importers**, out of 1 185 test files walked. That is the IMPORTER count, which
 * is a third unit again -- not the 273-file suite population, and not the 3 509 passing tests.
 * This docblock previously read "113 node + 80 jsdom = 193" and had drifted 34 files without
 * anything going red, because the assertions below floor at >150 on purpose (see the anti-vacuity
 * note on each). A number in prose beside a rule that never checks it is exactly the defect this
 * file exists to catch, so re-measure before quoting rather than trusting the line above.
