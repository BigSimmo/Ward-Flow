/**
 * THE SUBURB NOTE, AND THE MODEL FACT THAT IS THE ONLY REASON IT IS TRUE.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS FILE HAS ALREADY CAUGHT THE THING IT WAS BUILT FOR, AND THIS IS ITS SECOND POSTURE.**
 *
 * Until 2026-08-30 `Referral` carried `homeRegion` and nothing finer, so the intake form's Suburb
 * control was answered by a clinician and then deliberately dropped: it read the catchment for the
 * destination picker below it and went no further. The form SAID so, in a sentence beside the
 * control, rather than leaving a clinician to assume their answer was recorded — and this file
 * pinned that sentence against `Referral` having no `suburb` key, so that the day the model widened,
 * THIS FILE went red and sent whoever widened it straight to the sentence that had just become a
 * lie. That is exactly what happened. The note now says the opposite, because it is now the
 * opposite that is true.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE INVERSION IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND DELETING THE ASSERTION WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WRONG FIX.**
 * A pin that can no longer fail is worse than no pin: it looks like coverage while asserting
 * nothing. So the direction flipped and the teeth stayed. The three halves, none of them worth
 * anything alone:
 *
 *   1. The note is on screen, in words a clinician can read, saying the suburb IS recorded — so it
 *      cannot be quietly deleted, leaving a control whose fate is unstated.
 *   2. `Referral` STILL carries a `suburb` key — so the day the field is removed or renamed, this
 *      file goes red and sends whoever removed it to the sentence that has just become a lie in the
 *      other direction. A false reassurance that the record holds something it does not is the same
 *      defect as the one this file already caught, pointing the other way.
 *   3. The picker offers an HONEST "not known" answer, one option per `SUBURB_UNKNOWN_REASONS`
 *      member, derived rather than hand-listed. ⚠️ A person of no fixed abode, or one police brought
 *      in at 3am with no address known, MUST be referable — they are, if anything, more likely to
 *      need a bed. A required picker with no true option is what makes a clinician choose a
 *      plausible nearby suburb to get past the form, putting an invented place into the one field
 *      whose entire defence is that it resolves against a real table. A hand-written options list
 *      silently omitted this cohort here once, which is why half 3 counts against the constant.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A SUBURB IS NOT AN ADDRESS (`PD-3`), and nothing here licenses a finer one.** `address`
 * remains UNRULED and the guard stays closed on it; a street, a number or a postcode beside this
 * picker is forbidden however natural it feels.
 *
 * **Why the anchor is asserted before anything is asserted about what it found.** Half 2 reads a
 * type declaration out of another file's SOURCE TEXT, and the failure mode of every such check is
 * that the extraction matches nothing — after a rename, a reformat, or a move to another file — and
 * a verdict about "a block I never found" then reads exactly like a result. So the anchor is a test
 * of its own: exactly one declaration found, and a positive control (`homeRegion`, the other field
 * the note's history names) proving the key matcher can match at all. Neither the anchor test nor
 * the `suburb` assertion can pass vacuously.
 *
 * The anchor is the exact full line `export type Referral = {`, never a keyword search. Two sibling
 * declarations would swallow a looser pattern: `ReferralAddressing` in the same file, and the intake
 * form's own module-private `ReferralDraft`, which carries `suburb` as a raw `string` — a pattern
 * that caught either of those would report the right verdict for the wrong reason, which is the one
 * failure this file cannot detect from its own output.
 *
 * This file is `.test.ts`, not `.dom.test.tsx`, so it collects under vitest.config.mts's "node"
 * project: half 2 is a source-text check with no DOM in it, and halves 1 and 3 use
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` to render the real component tree to an HTML string, the "SSR-string
 * component test" pattern tests/ward-landmarks.test.ts already establishes for this same form.
 * `.ts` cannot contain JSX, so elements are built with `createElement`, exactly as that file does.

// Same reason as tests/ward-landmarks.test.ts: `ClinicalRail` (rendered by the intake form) uses
// next/link, and this suite never checks routing, so a plain <a> avoids an App Router context the
// node project cannot provide. The intake form also reads the URL through `next/navigation`'s
// `useSearchParams`; this is the `node` project with no `window` at all, so the mock returns an
// always-empty `URLSearchParams` rather than reading a real querystring nothing here has.
vi.mock("next/navigation", () => ({
  // The Ward Flow sidebar derives its role from the route (ward-nav-role-order.ts), so every
