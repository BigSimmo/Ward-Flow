  /**
   * ⚠️ **THIS FIGURE IS COUPLED TO TWO THINGS THAT DO NOT MENTION IT. READ THEM BEFORE CHANGING IT.**
   *
   *   1. `tests/ward-statistics.dom.test.tsx`, "the live world" — the same measurement rendered on
   *      the statistics screen, as `ward-statistics-join-matched-count` and
   *      `ward-statistics-join-coherent-count`. It moves whenever this does, and it is a separate
   *      file that will go red on its own.
   *   2. **The community hub.** `admissionBelongsToTeam`
   *      (`src/components/ward-management/community/community-derivations.ts`) does the SAME `find`
   *      over the SAME two arrays. A seeded admission whose `referralId` matches a real referral is
   *      simultaneously the only thing that makes this count non-nought and the only thing that can
   *      put anybody on one of the 65 community team pages. The two are one fact with two readers.
   *
   * The full account is `docs/ward-flow/fields-with-no-producer-2026-09-01.md` (final addendum).
   *
   * ⚠️ **THE MEASUREMENT THE SCREEN'S EMPTY STATE IS BUILT ON, AND THE FIGURE IN IT HAS MOVED TWICE.**
   * This asserted NINE matches until 2026-09-01. Those nine were then removed, for a separate
   * reason: they asked for no ward bed and were sitting at the top of the coordinator's
   * bed-matching queue. The join was then a true nought.
   *
   * ⚠️ **IT IS ONE SINCE THE `RF-007` SPLIT, AND ONE IS THE GOOD NEWS.** `AD-LEFT-01`
   * (`ward-admissions-seed.ts`) names `RF-010` (`ward-movements.ts`), the community-only referral
   * split out of `RF-007`. **The pair is chronologically coherent, which is the whole difference
   * between this and the nine:** `RF-010` is raised 24 days before the anchor and `AD-LEFT-01`
   * arrived 23 days ago, so `joinedCount` and `chronologicallyCoherentCount` are BOTH one. A future
   * change that makes them disagree — a match that cannot carry a duration — is the defect, not the
   * count moving.
   *
   * ⚠️ **THE NINE WERE AUTHORED, NOT ACCIDENTAL — and this comment said the opposite until the
   * merge of 2026-09-01.** `52ad01dda` added them deliberately, in its own words, "by using the ids
   * the admissions ALREADY hold, so not one admission changed", to close the first of two causes
   * that left all 65 community team pages empty. The earlier account of them as a collision between
   * the admissions fixture's ward tags and referrals that happened to share hospital abbreviations
   * was false, and so was "arriving weeks before the referral": three of the nine were 1.03, 3.03
   * and 5.04 days. The ~1-day case is the dangerous one, because it reads as a rounding error
   * rather than a category error.
   *
   * ⚠️ **BOTH HALVES ARE TRUE AND NEITHER ALONE IS THE STORY: the nine were DELIBERATE, and the
   * pairs they produced were NOT MEANINGFUL.** The pages genuinely rendered — that was the point of
   * authoring them — but every resulting pair has the patient arriving in the bed before the
   * referral existed, so not one could carry a duration. "It never worked" and "it worked by
   * coincidence" are both wrong; it worked on purpose, and what it showed was impossible. Both false claims were copied onto the SCREEN, and this test
   * stayed green through both — because it was measuring the count and nothing was watching the
   * reason. That is why the page no longer repeats either number in prose: it renders its counts
   * and explains only what a matched pair would have to be in order to date a bed, and that
   * sentence survives any value this test ends up asserting.
   *
   * ⚠️ **EVERY OTHER SEEDED ADMISSION STILL JOINS TO NOTHING, AND THAT IS WHY THE COUNT IS ONE
   * RATHER THAN MANY.** All four producers in `ward-admissions-seed.ts` MANUFACTURE `referralId`
   * from the admission's own id by string substitution, and `AD-LEFT-01` is the single exception
   * that names a real referral instead. So `withReferralIdCount` still equals the seeded admission
   * count by construction and remains evidence about the field rather than about the join.
   *
   * ⚠️ **DO NOT CLOSE THE REMAINING GAP BY RENAMING THE MANUFACTURED IDS TO MATCH REFERRALS.** That
   * is exactly what `52ad01dda` did, and it would make `joinedCount` jump while
   * `chronologicallyCoherentCount` stayed where it is — matched pairs that cannot carry a duration.
   * The two numbers below are asserted separately for that reason: they are what tells a real join
   * apart from a naming coincidence, and a single figure could not.
   *
   * ⚠️ **TEN SINCE 2026-09-05: `AD-LEFT-01` -> `RF-010` plus nine Midland DEMONSTRATION pairs**
   * (`MIDLAND_DEMONSTRATION_ROWS`, `ward-movements.ts`), added at the owner's request so one
   * community team's page has people on it. They are the manoeuvre the paragraph above warns about,
   * done with the timing it says is the whole difference: each is raised AND accepted before its
   * admission's bed was pulled, so both counts moved together. `tests/ward-community-demonstration-data.test.ts`
   * is where that timing is guarded pair by pair. **If these two numbers ever disagree, the fixture's
