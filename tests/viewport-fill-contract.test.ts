/**
 * Invariant 24, made file-agnostic: a page fills the box it is in; it never subtracts a
 * chrome estimate from `100dvh`. See `docs/search-chrome-behaviour.md` invariant 24 for
 * the three things such an estimate provably cannot know (the header's own top pad, the
 * `header-collapse-addon` nav row, and `#main-content`'s `sm:pb-8`), each measured as real
 * dead scroll before that contract landed.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE SCAN. The two guards that came before it --
 * `tests/ui-overlay-css-contract.test.ts` and `tests/mobile-interaction-regressions.test.ts`
 * -- are hard-coded allowlists of named files, each asserting that one literal string is
 * absent from one file. That shape cannot see a site it was never told about, which is
 * exactly how `src/components/mode-home-page-skeleton.tsx` kept two floors through PR #2419
 * and needed a follow-up sweep (`3b6e73c`, #2449) a day later. Worse, its second site was
 * written `h-[calc(100dvh-...)]` rather than `sm:min-h-[calc(...)]`, so even a repo-wide
 * search for that one literal would have missed half of it. This scan is therefore keyed on
 * the SHAPE of the offence, over the whole of `src/**`, not on a list of files.
 *
 * DESIGN DECISIONS, made deliberately:
 *
 * 1. `max-h` / `max-height` are OUT OF SCOPE and are never flagged. A bounded overlay
 *    (sheet, dialog, tooltip, sticky rail, expanded table) sizing itself to
 *    `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)]` is declaring a ceiling it must not exceed, which is the
 *    opposite failure mode from a page claiming a floor it cannot fill exactly. Invariant 24
 *    is about page-fill floors only. The matchers use a negative lookbehind so `max-h-` and
 *    `max-height:` cannot match through their `h-`/`height` tail.
 * 2. Mockups are design scratch and 404 in production, so `src/app/mockups/**`,
 *    `*-mockups.tsx` and `src/components/caring-contacts/mockups/**` are skipped outright.
 * 3. Comments are stripped before matching (block comments and whole-line `//`), because
 *    invariant 24 is discussed in prose in at least seven places -- `global-search-shell.tsx`,
 *    `mode-home-canvas.ts`, `mode-home-template.tsx`, `globals.css` -- and a guard that goes
 *    red on its own documentation teaches people to delete the documentation.
 * 4. The allowlist is EXACT-COUNT and fails closed in both directions. An entry that matches
 *    nothing is a stale entry and fails the test, so the list cannot quietly rot as files are
 *    refactored; an entry that matches more occurrences than it claims fails too, so a new
 *    offence cannot hide inside an already-exempt file.

// offence on the next, and a real block comment closing two lines later -- under the old
// block-first order this whole file went green with the offence still live in the scanned

/**
 * `min-h-[calc(100dvh-...)]` / `h-[calc(100svh-...)]` and every Tailwind variant prefix of

 * position it is preceded by `-`, and no start position earlier in `max-h-` can satisfy the
 * variant-chain group, which must end at a `:`.
 *
 * The separator before the `-` accepts underscores as well as whitespace. A Tailwind
 * arbitrary value cannot contain a literal space, so the spec-correct way to write the
 * subtraction is `min-h-[calc(100dvh_-_4rem)]`. Every occurrence in this repo today omits
 * the space entirely (`100dvh-12.5rem`), so the underscore form is currently unexercised —
 * but it is the form a contributor reaching for correct calc() syntax would write, and a
 * guard that misses it would be a guard the next offence walks straight past.
