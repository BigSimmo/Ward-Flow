   * instant but no single confirming role to name (it rolls up many wards' own confirmations).
   * Before this branch existed, `confirmedAt` present without `confirmedByRole` fell all the way
   * through to "Never confirmed" — which would have been a false claim about a rollup that HAS
   * been confirmed, just not by one nameable role. This is the branch the morning page's
   * `FreshnessLine` (morning-page.tsx) depends on to show its instant without inventing a second
   * freshness vocabulary.
