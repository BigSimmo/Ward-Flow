/**
 * A PULLED PATIENT HAS NOT ARRIVED, AND A CANCELLED PULL LEAVES NOBODY BEHIND.
 *
 * Owner ruling, 2026-09-01: *"a patient is not marked as arrived until the ward says they have
 * arrived. The pull just means the bed is allocated to them."*
 *
 * Two defects sat in `PULL_PATIENT`/`RELEASE_PULL` and neither was red:
 *
 *   1. The pull created an `Admission` stamped `state: "occupied"` with `arrivedAt` set to the
 *      instant of the pull — three stages before anybody had travelled anywhere. `daysInBed`
 *      counts from `arrivedAt`, so every stay begun by a pull was inflated by the whole transport
 *      delay, in the same direction every time, as a plausible number rather than a broken one.
 *   2. `RELEASE_PULL` gave the bed back to the unit and left that admission standing — a phantom
 *      occupant on the ward board, counted by `bedIsOccupied`, belonging to a movement that was
 *      back in the queue waiting for a bed the board said was taken.

 * EVERY BED FIGURE THIS PROJECT DERIVES FOR ONE UNIT, IN ONE OBJECT.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Deliberately NOT a list of the places a phantom occupant was expected to show up.** The
 * whole risk of deleting a record is the reference somebody else still holds, and enumerating the
 * consumers I happened to think of would test my imagination rather than the state. So this reads
 * the two derivations every capacity surface in the feature is built on (`unitCapacity` and
 * `capacityBreakdown`), the occupancy the ward board and the community hub both count
 * (`bedIsOccupied`), and the raw admission population — and the assertion is that the whole thing
 * balances back to where it started. A dangling reference shows up as a sum that no longer adds up,
 * whichever count is holding it.
