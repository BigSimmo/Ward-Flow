/**
 * THE STAGE STRIP DOES WHAT ITS NUMBERING PROMISES — AND THE FILTER CANNOT BE MISTAKEN FOR THE
 * WHOLE QUEUE.
 *
 * The strip's six waiting cells were `<span>`s: no handler, no tab stop, no role. The button-wiring
 * gate never fired precisely because they are not buttons, so nothing in the repository could
 * notice. What made them read as activatable was the NUMBERING — 1 to 6 is a pipeline you step
 * into — rather than any hover affordance.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE SAFETY PROBLEM IS NOT THE WIRING, IT IS WHAT A FILTER DOES TO A DEMAND FIGURE.** A queue
 * showing 14 rows when 43 people are waiting is the most dangerous screen in this prototype if the
 * reader cannot instantly tell which of those two numbers they are looking at. So the count in the
 * panel header is pinned here to the TRUE OPEN TOTAL in every filtered state — it is the figure a
 * coordinator reads as "how much demand is there", and a filter must never be able to shrink it.
 * The filtered subset is stated separately, in words, with an always-present way out.
 *
 * These assertions are therefore mostly about what does NOT change when a filter is applied.
