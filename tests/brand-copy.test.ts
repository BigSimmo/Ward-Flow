 * The product's written identity has one home (`src/lib/brand.ts`).
 *
 * Before it did, four surfaces described PsychSift four different ways — the
 * page metadata, the web manifest, the OG card and the install prompt each
 * carried a hand-typed sentence, and two of them disagreed about whether the
 * product is a "RAG knowledge base" or a "knowledge base". Nobody had made a
 * decision to say two different things; the second sentence was written months
 * after the first by someone who could not see it.
 *
 * So this file guards the property that made that possible: a brand line
 * re-typed as a literal at the point of use. The check is deliberately narrow —
 * it does not police every mention of the product, only the specific lines the
 * module owns, and only outside the module itself.

 * The 2026-09-02 audit found the llms.txt half of it (L86) only because a
 * Playwright assertion had been written to pin the stale string.
 *
 * A name is not a line this module can own the way it owns the taglines above:
 * "PsychSift" is written as a literal in over a hundred places and routing all
 * of them through an import would be a migration, not a guard. So the guard runs
