/**
 * THE PLACEMENT RULE IS ABOUT WHAT A READER SEES, AND THE EXISTING GUARDS ASSERT DOM ORDER.
 *
 * 🔴 THE LIVE DEFECT THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN AGAINST, measured 2026-09-05 and not hypothetical.
 *
 * `person-screen.tsx` renders two sensitive fields — Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status
 * and interpreter / preferred language — under a rule with two halves: they must not sit adjacent
 * to each other, and neither may sit directly above a psychiatric history panel. The field ORDER
 * separates them with GP, and `tests/ward-patient-placement-fields.dom.test.tsx` asserts that
 * order, each half proved by its own mutation.
 *
 * **`.factList` is `display: grid` with `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(9rem, 1fr))`
 * and `gap: 0.75rem`.** So the number of columns is whatever fits, and the eight placement facts
 * reflow. Computed for each column count:
 *
 *     1 col : Aboriginal r4c1, interpreter r6c1  -> separated
 *     2 cols: Aboriginal r2c2, interpreter r3c2  -> **VERTICALLY ADJACENT**
 *     3 cols: Aboriginal r2c1, interpreter r2c3  -> same row, separated by GP
 *     4 cols: Aboriginal r1c4, interpreter r2c2  -> separated
 *
 * **Two columns is a phone in portrait.** `auto-fit` fills `floor((W + gap) / (9rem + gap))` tracks;
 * a 375px viewport less the panel's padding is about 21.9rem, which gives exactly 2. So on the
 * device a ward coordinator actually holds, **the two fields the rule keeps apart are stacked one
 * directly above the other** — and every DOM-order assertion stays green, because the DOM order
 * never changed.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND I ASSERTED THE OPPOSITE IN WRITING BEFORE READING THE FILE.**
 * `docs/ward-flow/design/patient-page-second-edition-spec.md` said *"today the facts render as a
 * single-column `<dl>`, so DOM order and reading order are the same thing and the tests are
 * sound"*, and framed the multi-column risk as something a future redesign **would introduce**. It
 * was already there. I described the current state from assumption while writing a document whose
 * entire subject was that assumption's failure mode.
 *
 * WHY THIS GUARD READS CSS AND NOT THE DOM: jsdom computes no layout, so `offsetTop`,
 * `getBoundingClientRect` and computed grid placement are all zero or absent there. A guard
 * asserting positions in jsdom would pass on any stylesheet whatsoever — a check that cannot fail.
 * The stylesheet text is the only thing available offline that carries the answer, so the property
 * asserted is: **the placement fact list resolves to ONE column at every width.**

/** The rule body for a class, `@media` blocks included, by brace matching. */
/**
 * COMMENTS STRIPPED BEFORE MATCHING - AND THE OMISSION MADE THIS GUARD FIGHT ANYONE DOCUMENTING THE
 * RULE IT PROTECTS.
 *
 * `ruleBodies` finds a rule by matching its selector as literal text and scanning forward to the
 * next opening brace. Without stripping comments, **a mention of the selector in prose is a match**:
 * the scan runs past the rest of the comment and attaches whatever brace comes next as a fabricated
 * rule body. On this stylesheet that body was the definition-table rule below, whose two-track
 * `grid-template-columns` was then reported as a violation of the one-column rule above it.
 *
 * FOUND BY THE SESSION BUILDING THE PATIENT PAGE, and proved rather than reasoned: its first draft
 * of the comment explaining the layout named the selector several times and made this guard fail
 * with the two-track value quoted back. It worked around it by never spelling the selector out -
 * a workaround that imposed a permanent restriction on every future editor of that comment.
 *
 * THAT WORKAROUND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY AND IS NOT NOW. This is the mirror of the rule
 * three other guards here already follow: a guard that scans source text is satisfied by prose
 * unless it excludes prose - and, in this direction, DEFEATED by prose. Same mechanism, opposite
 * sign: there a comment made a guard pass, here a comment made it fail.
 *
 * A false failure is the milder of the two and still costs: it teaches the next person that
 * documenting the thing is dangerous, which is exactly backwards for a rule whose whole defence is
 * that somebody reads why it exists.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHERE THE COMMENT SITS DECIDES WHETHER THE DEFECT HAPPENS AT ALL, AND MY FIRST MUTATION PUT
 * IT IN THE ONE PLACE THAT CANNOT REPRODUCE IT.** The selector pattern requires no brace between
 * the mention and the next `{`. A mention INSIDE a rule body therefore matches nothing — the next
 * character that matters is the body's own `}` — so a comment there is harmless with or without the
 * strip, and a mutation placed there reports SURVIVED on the broken code and proves nothing. The
 * defect needs a mention in a block comment sitting ABOVE some OTHER rule, where the next `{` is
 * that rule's. Measured on this stylesheet, both placements, against the code with and without the
 * strip:
 *
 *     inside the rule body        no strip: 1 body ["1fr"]   strip: 1 body ["1fr"]
 *     above the definition table  no strip: 2 bodies ["1fr", "minmax(9rem, 14rem) 1fr"]
 *                                 strip:    1 body   ["1fr"]
 *
 * The second row's phantom body is the failure the patient-page session hit, with the two-track
 * value quoted back at it. **A mutation aimed at the wrong location is indistinguishable from an
 * assertion that does not cover the property** — both print SURVIVED. Aim it where the mechanism
 * says the defect lives, and check the mutant is the mutant you described.

     * A guard that recomputed "which cell does each field land in" would have to model auto-fit,
     * the container width and the panel's padding — three things this file cannot see and which a
     * redesign changes freely. **One column is the only condition under which the DOM order the
     * other guards assert IS the reading order**, which is what makes the existing mutation-proved
     * tests mean what they claim.
     *
     * `auto-fit`/`auto-fill` with a `minmax()` track is what produced the defect: it silently
     * becomes as many columns as fit. Any multi-track template is rejected, in the base block and
     * in every media block, because a rule that holds at one width and not another is exactly the
     * shape that let this reach a phone unnoticed.
     *
     * 🔴 REWRITTEN AFTER WARD VERIFIER BROKE IT THREE WAYS, ALL FALSE PASSES, ALL OUTSIDE THE
     * PROPERTY IT READ. The whitelist of template values was sound — no multi-column value slips
     * through it. **The bypasses were that `grid-template-columns` is not where the column count is
     * decided.**
     *
     *   (a) `if (!template) continue` — an ABSENT declaration was skipped. Change this rule to
     *       `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap` and there is no `grid-template-columns` at all: zero
     *       offenders, guard green, two columns on a 375px phone, and Aboriginal status is directly
     *       above interpreter language again.
     *   (b) `grid-auto-flow: column` beside a whitelisted `none` or `auto` produces columns from a
     *       value this guard called single-column. It never read that property.
     *   (c) the `grid-template:` shorthand sets columns without the longhand ever appearing.
     *
     * ⚠️ **(a) IS NOT EXOTIC — IT IS THE HOUSE STYLE.** Measured across ward CSS: `flex-wrap` 91
     * occurrences, `grid-auto-flow` 1, `grid-template:` shorthand 0. **So the likeliest future edit
     * to this rule is precisely the one the first version could not see.**
     *
     * ⚠️ **AND THE PREMISE THAT FAILED IS THE SAME SHAPE AS THE ONE THIS FILE EXISTS TO CORRECT.**
     * The spec said "the facts render as a single-column definition list" — true-sounding, already
     * false. This guard said "the column count lives in `grid-template-columns`" — true of the rule
     * in front of me, false of the codebase by a factor of ninety. **A correct observation about
     * one file, generalised into a rule about the system.** Twice, in two hours, by the same hand.
     *
     * So the assertion is now POSITIVE — the rule must still BE a single-column grid — and an
     * absent declaration is a failure rather than a skip. A guard that can only reject known-bad
     * values passes on every layout it was not taught about.

     *
     *   1. the comment still names `.factList` literally — a tidy that drops the mention ends it;

     * witnessing, this goes red and says why.
     *
     * ⚠️ It is deliberately NOT the shape where a filter and an assertion share a predicate and
