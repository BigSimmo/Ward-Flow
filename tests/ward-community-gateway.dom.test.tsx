/**
 * THE COMMUNITY GATEWAY (redesign v1) — guarded on the CLAIM and the CLINICAL PROPERTY, never on
 * rendering. The owner is redesigning many Ward Flow pages; a guard that goes red on a legitimate
 * restyle gets deleted, and an honest guard sitting beside it goes with it. So nothing below pins a
 * class name, a whole sentence, spacing, colour, DOM shape, or a positional index.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE PROPERTY THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS: THIS PAGE COMPUTES NO "READS ALIKE" GROUPING OF ITS
 * OWN.** `community-vocabulary.ts`'s `communityNameCollisions()` is the one derivation the owner has
 * ruled must feed every surface — two independent implementations of "do these names read alike"
 * have already produced two separate live bugs neither a count nor a class name would have caught.
 * Every expectation below is therefore built from that same function, one layer under the page, the
 * same discipline `tests/ward-community-near-duplicate-warning.dom.test.tsx` already holds
 * `community-screen.tsx`'s per-team warning to. If a future edit here recomputed collisions locally
 * instead of reading the shared function, this file's own expectations would move with the
 * component and every assertion would silently keep passing — which is exactly why the sibling
 * suite's own comment calls that shape "not pedantry".
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE POPULATION IS FLOORED, NOT THE FINDINGS.** The very first test below asserts the walked
 * list is non-empty and that BOTH a marked and an unmarked team exist, before anything else in this
 * file is trusted — a seed with no collisions, or with nothing but collisions, would make the
 * biconditional test pass vacuously over an empty side.

   *                               They read a team's name out of the link's `textContent`, so the
   *                               injected words corrupted the NAME and were reported as
