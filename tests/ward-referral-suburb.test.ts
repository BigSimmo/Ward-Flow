/**
 * A REFERRAL RECORDS THE SUBURB, AND THE SUBURB IS RESOLVED AGAINST THE REAL TABLE.
 *
 * `CM-4`: **suburb is the recorded fact.** It is the coarsest fact the owner's catchment documents
 * are keyed on and the finest one that is stable. `PD-3`: ⚠️ **a suburb is not an address** — it
 * identifies a service area, not a dwelling — which is why `PD-1`'s permission to hold facts about
 * a person reaches it while `address` stays unruled and closed.
 *
 * ⚠️ **PROVENANCE: relayed to this session by Ward Referrals, not heard first-hand.** `R55` exists
 * because a relay written down twice becomes indistinguishable from a direct ruling, so it is
 * recorded as a relay here and in the field's own comment. The design basis (`CM-4`, `PD-3`) is
 * first-hand in the register and is what this is built on.
 *
 * ⚠️ **CHECKED AGAINST THE TABLE, NEVER FOR NON-EMPTINESS.** The same move as `edId` resolving
 * against the real network: `"12 Wellington St"` is a non-empty string and would sail through a
 * length check, putting a street address into the one field whose whole defence is that it is
 * coarser than one. `referralSuburbIsKnown` asks the catchment source, which is the only thing that
 * can actually answer.
 *
 * ⚠️ **"KNOWN" IS NOT "HAS A CATCHMENT", AND CONFLATING THE TWO WOULD REJECT REAL PATIENTS.** The
 * table carries a suburb with no follow-up clinic recorded against it, and a suburb whose two
 * readings disagree. Both are known places. A referral from one must be recordable; whether anybody
 * can route it is a different question, asked later, by the catchment lookup itself.
