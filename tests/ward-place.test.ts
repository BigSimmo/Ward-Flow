/**
 * `wardPlaceFor` — the place a route puts you in, or `undefined` where there is no place.
 *
 * Every name asserted below is READ from the same source module `wardPlaceFor` itself reads for
 * that kind (EDs and community teams: `ward-sites.ts`, `community-derivations.ts`), never typed
 * as a literal — a literal here would be a second copy of the name that could drift from the
 * first and the test would never notice. Ward units are the one exception, and deliberately so:
 * `wardPlaceFor` no longer reads `unitById` at all (whole-branch review I1) — it takes the
 * caller's live `units` as a parameter, the same shape `eligibleCandidatesAmong` takes. Most
 * tests below pass `allUnits()` as a stand-in for "the provider's live units, unchanged from the
 * fixture", so the names still come from that same source; the dedicated test further down
 * passes a unit list that DIFFERS from the fixture and asserts the passed-in name wins, which is
 * the property this parameterisation exists to prove.
