/**
 * THE COMMUNITY TEAM COUNT — CHECKED AGAINST ITS OWN SOURCE, NEVER AGAINST A TYPED-IN NUMBER.
 *
 * The community index page (`community-index.tsx`) renders one link per community mental health
 * team, and today that is 65 links. `tests/ward-community-index.test.ts` deliberately does not pin
 * that number — its own comment explains why: "sixty-five" was once written into two files' prose,
 * a seed edit made both claims false, and nothing went red. That comment also says the exact-size
 * pin belongs in the fixture's own suite, and names `tests/ward-community-hub.test.ts` as the
 * intended home — but that file is held by another change right now, so this is a NEW file rather
 * than an edit to an existing one (per this task's instructions), covering the same ground: the
 * rendered count checked against a count DERIVED from source, so the two move together.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHY NOT `expect(count).toBe(65)`.** The owner has said he is likely to add or remove teams
 * soon. A hardcoded 65 breaks the moment he does, and whoever hits that failure "fixes" it by
 * typing in the new number — which turns the assertion into one that can never catch a real defect,
 * exactly the class of check this project exists to root out (see `statistics-derivations.ts`'s own
 * record of a paragraph that falsified itself silently four times). So the expectation below is
 * computed from `S2015_CATCHMENT_ROWS` — the extracted source table `communityTeamOptions()` reads
 * — every time this test runs, not typed as a literal.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE DERIVATION IS DELIBERATELY NOT A CALL TO `communityTeamOptions()`.**
 * `COMMUNITY_TEAM_PAGES` (what the page renders) is a straight `.map()` over
 * `communityTeamOptions()`, so if a truncation happened INSIDE that function — a stray `.slice()`,
 * a dropped-singleton filter — both the page and an expectation computed by calling that same
 * function would shrink together and this test would stay green while the screen showed a wrong
 * number. `tests/ward-community-hub.test.ts` already found and fixed exactly this failure mode
 * (its own comment calls it "finding 9.7 / 13.4": a table trimmed from 65 clinics to 3, or to 43,
 * left its now-superseded same-function comparison green both times). So this file re-derives the
 * count independently, straight from `S2015_CATCHMENT_ROWS`, with its own normalisation — a second,
 * deliberately separate implementation of the same idea as the production `communityTeamKey`
 * (unexported, so it cannot be called from here even by accident).
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE FLOOR GUARD, AND WHY IT IS NOT OPTIONAL.** Even with an independent derivation, the
 * derivation and the render still ultimately read the same upstream fact: `S2015_CATCHMENT_ROWS`.
 * If that source collapsed to empty — a broken import, a bad filter applied upstream, a data file
 * that failed to load — the independently-derived expectation would ALSO collapse to 0, the render
 * would ALSO show 0, and `expect(renderedCount).toBe(expectedCount)` would pass on 0 === 0. "They
 * match" is true and completely useless in that case. The floor guard below is what makes that
 * impossible: it asserts the derived expectation is comfortably above what any plausible accidental
 * collapse would produce, BEFORE the equality check ever runs, so a collapse — to 0, or to some
 * small wrong number like 3 — fails loudly on the floor rather than silently agreeing with itself.
