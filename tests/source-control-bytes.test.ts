// tests/source-control-bytes.test.ts
//
// No stray control byte in the repository's own source.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is a count rather than a worry: the same hazard landed three times in one
// week. A backspace escape ate a character in a worktree path in `task-8-report.md`; the same
// report's sentence EXPLAINING that escape still carried two literal `0x08` bytes months later; and
// `tests/caring-contacts-plan-wizard.dom.test.tsx` shipped a regex family whose every `\b` reached
// the file as a backspace, so the patterns read `/<BS>the one write<BS>/i` and matched nothing —
// an assertion that could not fail, in a check written to catch stale claims.
//
// The third one is the argument for a durable guard rather than more care. It passed lint,
// typecheck, Prettier, the workspace guard set and the full suite, because a control byte inside a
// string or a regex is syntactically fine and semantically invisible. Only mutation testing found
// it, and only because someone happened to write a mutation aimed at something else.
//
// WHY A TEST RATHER THAN A LINT RULE OR A HOOK. ESLint only sees what it lints — not Markdown, not
// JSON, not shell — and the two of the three occurrences that reached the tree were in a Markdown
// report. A pre-commit hook does not run in CI, and `core.hooksPath` is per-checkout, so an agent
// pushing from its own environment bypasses it. The precedent is already here: the CR-byte check on
// the Claude hook scripts lives in `tests/session-start-hook.test.ts`, for the same reason.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT POLICE. The carriage return. `.gitattributes` sets `* text=auto
// eol=lf` and the hook-script test already fails on CR in the blobs where it is dangerous. Widening
// here would put two guards on one rule and make the second one's failures somebody else's to
// interpret — so CR is permitted by this check and owned by those.
