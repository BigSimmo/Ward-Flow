/**
 * 🔴 **THE OWNER'S RULING WAS RECORDED, GUARDED, MUTATION-PROVED — AND RENDERED NOWHERE FOR HOURS.
 * THIS IS THE GUARD THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT.**
 *
 * On 2026-09-05 the owner ruled that four spellings of the Inner City team are one service. The
 * table landed with seven guards over it. **Not one of them asked whether any component imported
 * it**, so a reader on the `ICC` page saw nothing at all — **precisely the gap the ruling was made
 * to close** — and a reader on `Inner City` saw `Inner City Clinic` described as a near-duplicate
 * SPELLING when a person had ruled it the same SERVICE.
 *
 * ⚠️ **BOTH HALVES WERE INDIVIDUALLY CORRECT. THE COMBINATION WAS SILENT.** Same shape as the
 * `WF-008` patient-status defect found the same night: two faithfully-merged screens whose
 * combination started saying something false. **A guard over a record is not a guard over what a
 * reader sees.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE EXPECTATION IS BUILT FROM `RATIFIED_SERVICE_ALIASES` DIRECTLY, NOT FROM
 * `ratifiedSameServiceNames` — the function the page calls.** Deriving it from the page's own
 * helper is the tautology this project measured twice today: the expectation moves with the defect
 * and the suite stays green. The table is the data; the helper is code under test.

/**
 * 🔴 **A CONSTANT CEILING OVER A GROWING POPULATION DECIDES ITS VERDICT BY MACHINE LOAD.**
 *
 * The sweeps below render EVERY community team page, one at a time, in jsdom. Vitest's default
 * per-test ceiling is a flat 30 s. The page list is not flat — it is derived from the source
 * document and grows whenever a team is added. So the cost side grows and the limit side does not,
 * and the gap closes silently until a run on a busy machine lands on the wrong side of it.
 *
 * **Measured, not assumed.** Ward Builder Three recorded this file at **33.5 s against the 30 s
 * ceiling on 2026-09-07** and wrote the diagnosis that matters: *"not randomly flaky — it runs
 * close enough to the limit that machine load decides the verdict."* Re-measured 2026-09-10 with
 * only these two files running: **both timed out**, so the margin Three measured is gone.
 *
 * ⚠️ **"Flaky under load" was the wrong description and it hid the repair for three days.** A flake
 * is re-run until green. This is not that: it is red for as long as it stays this slow, and four
 * sessions reported the mutation harness as *broken* on the strength of the same 30 s timeout.
 *
 * **So the budget is derived from the population rather than raised to a new constant** — which
 * would simply reset the same trap one team further out.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The per-page figure below is the second one I wrote, and the first was wrong in a way worth
 * naming.** I divided a TIMED-OUT duration (34 s — the run that never finished) by a page count I
 * had from a different reading (43, when the list actually holds 64) and got "~0.8–0.9 s per page".
 * Neither half was measured from the same thing. A timed-out duration is not how long the work
 * takes; it is how long we waited before giving up. **The real figures, from the passing runs:**
 *
 *     64 team pages
 *     ratified-alias sweep     27.4 s   ≈ 0.43 s per page
 *     near-duplicate sweep     24.5 s   ≈ 0.38 s per page
 *
 * At 3 s per page the budget is 192 s — roughly **7× headroom**, not the 3.5× the wrong arithmetic
 * claimed.
 *
 * **What this deliberately no longer does:** it no longer polices per-page performance. A ceiling
 * this generous catches a runaway, not a slow drift. The per-page figure above is recorded so the
 * drift is still legible to whoever reads a slow run — the alternative was a limit that fails on
 * correct work, which is how a guard gets switched off rather than obeyed.
