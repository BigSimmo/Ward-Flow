/**
 * THE STAGE STRIP HAS TO RECONCILE WITH THE QUEUE BESIDE IT.
 *
 * The strip is seven numbered cells above a panel headed "Priority queue". Until 2026-08-30 every
 * cell counted movements AT that stage regardless of whether the person was still waiting, so the
 * seven cells summed to 50 while the queue beneath them said 43, with nothing on screen to explain
 * the gap.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE OBVIOUS REMEDY IS WRONG BY ONE, AND WRONG IN THE DIRECTION THAT HIDES ITSELF.** Both
 * reviewers who found this recommended putting stage 7 "Arrived" outside the queue total. That
 * gives 44, not 43 — because `isOpen` is TWO conditions, `!closure && stage !== "arrived"`, and a
 * movement that does not proceed closes at whatever stage it had reached. This fixture holds
 * exactly one such record, sitting inside stages 1 to 6.
 *
 * So the arrived-only remedy produces a strip that LOOKS like it adds up and does not. That is
 * worse than the original defect: 50 beside 43 is visibly unreconciled and invites the question,
 * whereas 44 beside 43 invites the arithmetic and then fails it, once, silently, for a reader who
 * has no way to see which cell is lying.
 *
 * The assertions below therefore check the WHOLE reconciliation — the waiting cells sum to the
 * queue count, the left-the-pathway cell holds the remainder, and the two together account for
 * every movement. A test that only checked "arrived is outside" would pass the wrong fix.
