/**
 * 🔴 **THE DISCHARGE-DATES SENTENCE PRESENTS TWO POPULATIONS AS ONE, AND THE DERIVATION SAID SO IN
 * ADVANCE.** Found on 2026-09-06 by opening a ward page, which rendered:
 *
 * > Of 1 with a date written down, 1 met, 0 missed and 11 moved.
 *
 * Eleven of one. Every number there is CORRECT — which is what makes this the dangerous kind. The
 * arithmetic is right, the types are right, and `ward-statistics.ts` states the rule the screen
 * breaks, in its own doc comment, one file away:
 *
 * > `met`/`missed`/`moved` are therefore NOT a three-way partition of the same population and must
 * > never be summed to `consideredCount`.
 *
 * `moved` is counted over EVERY admission on the ward. `met` and `missed` are counted only over the
 * admissions that have both a date and have actually left. `consideredCount` is `met + missed`. So
 * `moved` is drawn from a strictly larger population, and "Of N …, X met, Y missed and Z moved"
 * puts all three inside the one denominator the clause opens with.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE EMPTY BRANCH STATES A FALSEHOOD RATHER THAN A DIFFERENT TRUTH.** It fires on
 * `consideredCount === 0`, which means "no outcome has resolved yet", and it says *no admission on
 * this ward has had a discharge date written down*. On a ward whose every admission carries a
 * planned discharge date and where nobody has left yet, that sentence is untrue — and it is the
 * reading a coordinator would act on, because it says the planning has not happened.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE SAME BRANCH SILENTLY DROPS `moved`.** A ward with no resolved outcome and eight revised
 * discharge dates publishes neither number, and asserts the absence of the first.
 *
 * 🔴 **NOTHING HERE ASSERTS A WORDING, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.** Ward Lead's standing rule is to
 * guard the claim and the clinical property, never the rendering — and a wording pin would go green
 * again on any of the three rephrasings that leave the defect in place. These assert the property:
 * a figure may not be presented inside a total it exceeds, and the page may not assert an absence
 * the fixture contradicts. Reword the block however you like and they stay green.
