/**
 * The checker's own tests.
 *
 * `scripts/check-ward-data.mjs` exists so that a wrong bed number produces a sentence the product
 * owner can act on. Two things therefore have to be true of it, and only the second is usually
 * tested: it has to stay quiet on data that is right, and it has to go RED — with a readable
 * message — on data that is wrong. So every test below asserts the MESSAGE TEXT, not merely that a
 * problem was counted: a checker that fails with "invariant violated" has failed at the only job it
 * has.
 *
 * Every failing case is built from a constructed fixture, never by editing a real data file. That
 * is not only tidiness: the real files are owned by other work in flight, and a check proved red by
 * mutating one is a check proved once and never again.
 *
 * The fixture uses the app's OWN `unitCapacity` and `bedIsOccupied`, exactly as the script does, so
 * these tests cannot pass against a second, drifting copy of the arithmetic.

  /**
   * COLUMN SERVICES IS CURRENTLY UNCHECKED, RECORDED RATHER THAN HIDDEN.
   *
   * At the ward board fold (2026-08-29) this checker met Phase 8's rewritten network screen for the
   * first time. `columnServices` still has `left:` and `right:` keys, but they are no longer literal
   * arrays:
   *
   *   left:  LEFT_COLUMN_SERVICES
   *   right: wardServiceOrder.filter((service) => !LEFT_COLUMN_SERVICES.includes(service))
   *
   * The right-hand side is computed at runtime, and a text parser cannot resolve it. So reteaching
   * the parser is NOT mechanical: it would mean reimplementing that filter in the checker, where it
   * could silently diverge from the screen it is meant to be checking.
   *
   * The rule applied here, and it is the whole point: the checker is NOT loosened to make this pass.
   * It reports "nothing is checking the columnServices list, so treat that as unchecked rather than
   * correct" — an honest failure — and this test now pins that exact state so the gap is visible in
   * the suite rather than absent from it.
   *
   * TO CLOSE IT: give `HealthService` a runtime array (it is the only multi-value union in
   * ward-model.ts without one) and derive both columns from it. Then this fact stops needing to be
   * text-parsed at all, and this test goes back to asserting no reading problems.
