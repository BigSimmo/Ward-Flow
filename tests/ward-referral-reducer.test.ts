// (both ["ward", "coordinator"] since owner ruling FD-25, 2026-08-30; coordinator-only before). Every guard named in the task brief gets its own test here, and every

    // seeded record to demonstrate against, not only the reducer-built fixture in

    // Thirteen since 2026-09-04: RF-012 and RF-013 are the origins of WF-002 and WF-009 (owner

    // They had to be AUTHORED rather than picked from the eleven above: a journey cannot precede
    // the referral that produced it, and every existing ED-addressed referral was raised long
    // after the youngest movement at its own department. See their comment in `ward-movements.ts`.
    // Twenty-two since 2026-09-05: nine DEMONSTRATION referrals naming the community team
    // "Midland" (`MIDLAND_DEMONSTRATION_ROWS`, `ward-movements.ts`), added at the owner's request so
    // one community team's page has people on it. They reuse ids the admissions seed already

   * checks into the eligibility verdict; that never touches `SUITABILITY_GATES`, so THIS TEST
   * STAYS GREEN THROUGH IT, under a title claiming the opposite. A green test making a false
