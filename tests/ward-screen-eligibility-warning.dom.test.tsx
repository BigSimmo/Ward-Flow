 * The sub-finding in `docs/ward-flow/the-engine-enforces-nothing.md`: `REFER_TO_UNITS`,
 * `ACCEPT_IN_PRINCIPLE` and `PULL_PATIENT` check nothing about cohort, security, sex or forensic
 * status, so a ward can accept — and pull — a movement `eligibility()` would refuse outright, and
 * see nothing on its own screen. This suite drives the exact pair the finding demonstrated: WF-009
 * (Adult, Secure, Male, specialling, involuntary/detained under a 3B form) into
 * `brm-adult-secure`, the network's forensic bed, through the same real reducer events
 * (`REFER_TO_UNITS` then `ACCEPT_IN_PRINCIPLE`) the finding used — never a hand-authored fixture.
 *
 * This warning is INFORMATION, never a gate — the invariant guarded here (`referralAnswerBlocked`/
 * `pullBlockedReason` in `ward-screen.tsx` mirror the reducer's own eligibility-free checks so the
 * accept/decline/pull buttons "can never advertise different verdicts about whether the reducer
 * would take the action") must hold exactly as before: the warning changes what the ward is told,
 * never what its buttons do.
