/**
 * A file under `tests/` is only actually tested if SOME runner's include/testMatch pattern
 * collects it. `vitest.config.mts` runs two projects on disjoint globs (`tests/**\/*.test.ts` for
 * node, `tests/**\/*.dom.test.tsx` for jsdom); `playwright.config.ts` adds three more patterns. A file whose name satisfies none of them runs
 * nothing, reports nothing, and — because `vitest run` walks its include globs rather than
 * enumerating `tests/` and complaining about leftovers — a whole-suite run is simply silent about
 * it. `tests/foo.test.tsx` (missing the `.dom.` infix the jsdom project requires) is the shape
 * that keeps recurring, because it is the most natural name to give a React component test.
 *
 * This file computes the real pattern set from the configs themselves (not from a copy of the
 * two globs someone remembers), and checks every file on disk against it — both files named like
 * a test that no pattern admits, and files that read like a test (a top-level `describe`/`it`/
 * `test` call) despite carrying no test-shaped extension at all.
 *
 * What this cannot see: an environment-variable branch changes which project a file belongs to
 * (`ALLOW_PROVIDER_TESTS=true` swaps the node project onto `*.live.test.ts`) rather than which
 * files exist at all, so both branches are unioned in below as "visible" — a file reachable by
 * either is not orphaned, even though a bare `npm run test` does not collect the live files. A
 * CI matrix step that filters the file list after config resolution, or a config this repo does
 * not have yet, would also be outside what a static read of these configs can prove.
