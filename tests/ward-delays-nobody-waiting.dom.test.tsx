/**
 * 🔴 **THE DELAYS SCREEN CRASHED ON THE BEST DAY IT COULD HAVE, AND THIS IS THE STATE ITSELF.**
 *
 * `waitingSplit` returns its three bands all at zero whenever no movement is open, and `WardBar`
 * throws on an all-zero total — deliberately, because an empty rail reads as a loading state. The
 * screen rendered the bar with no guard, so when nobody was waiting in any emergency department the
 * page went blank. Every other state this screen can be in is worse than that one, and it was the
 * only state that killed it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **UNTIL TODAY THIS TEST COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN.** `DelaysScreen` read every movement from
 * the provider, whose seed always has people waiting, so the failing state was unreachable from a
 * test — the screen most exposed to the defect was the one whose empty state could not be rendered.
 * The strongest guard available was `ward-bar-zero-is-reachable.test.ts`, which scans the source for
 * a guard's PRESENCE and cannot tell a correct guard from a wrong one. That file still earns its
 * place — it walks every call site, so it catches the next screen to forget one — but this is the
 * one that renders the crash.
 *
 * **Both are kept deliberately.** The scan covers screens whose empty state is still unreachable;
 * this covers whether the guard actually works. Neither subsumes the other.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND IT ASSERTS THE KIND OF ZERO, NOT JUST THE ABSENCE OF A CRASH.** Ward Lead's ruling of
 * 2026-09-06: a MEASURED none is stated in a plain word; the absence sentence is reserved for a
 * figure nothing could produce. Not crashing is satisfied by writing "nothing here can say how many
 * are waiting" — which would be false over a real, running count. So the wrong sentence is failed
 * as explicitly as the crash is.
