 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Owner ruling, 2026-09-01: "A pull cannot occur unless the bed is actually
 * available and open, not pending (i.e. being cleaned)."
 *
 * Before it, a patient could be pulled to a bed that was still being cleaned. `PULL_PATIENT` refused only
 * when `allocatable` hit zero, and `availableNow` reads no readiness field at all — which
 * `ward-bed-availability.ts` documented as deliberate, reasoning that a bed being prepared is still
 * worth counting because the pull takes hours anyway. The owner overruled that reasoning.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE TEST THAT WOULD PASS ON A WRONG VALUE HERE is one asserting a screen says "pending". That is
 * satisfied by a label. Every assertion below is about a STATE TRANSITION being refused.
