 * THE WARD'S DAILY SHEET — D19's handover sheet, with DB-10/DB-11/DB-12's live stamp.
 *
 * Two failure classes are worth a test here and the rest is decoration:
 *
 *   1. **A figure that is merely computed rather than POSSIBLE.** A sibling panel on this very
 *      board shipped "Kimberley 28 people" on a twenty-bed ward with nine passing assertions,
 *      because the caller handed a correct derivation the whole network's 267 records. So every
 *      count on the sheet is checked against a per-unit derivation computed independently here,
 *      across all 23 seeded units, and additionally bounded by the ward's own bed count.
 *   2. **A stamp that can lie** (DB-12). If the "as at" line read the wall clock while the figures
 *      read the provider's `now`, the sheet would assert a moment it is not showing — in the one
 *      element DB-10 deliberately made load-bearing, and on the strength of which DB-11 removed the
 *      frozen view. That defect is invisible to every test that does not look at the clock, so
 *      these tests look at it twice: once by pinning the rendered stamp to the anchor the figures
 *      are derived from, and once by asserting the stamp tracks its argument rather than any clock.
