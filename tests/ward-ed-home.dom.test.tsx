/**
 * 🔴 **RETIRED 2026-09-06 — OWNER RULING: THE ELEVEN REPLACED WARD SCREENS ARE FINISHED WITH.**

 * `EdHome` is reached by no route. These 12 cases are skipped, not deleted: the
 * source stays, and every case's own words are recorded in
 * `docs/ward-flow/retired-coverage-record-2026-09-06.md` so the cover is recoverable if the
 * screen is ever revived. ⚠️ **A retired test with no record of its subject is a deletion
 * wearing a softer word.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE COMPONENT IS NOT DELETED BY THIS RULING, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.** This repository
 * forbids removing an exported symbol on a "nothing imports it" basis, and three of the defects
 * found on 2026-09-06 were held in place BY unreachability — which is more fragile than a live
 * defect, not less. **An unreachable wrong screen is a fix, not a delete.** What closes here is
 * the false coverage, which was the actual harm.
 *
 * **Do not un-skip these to make a number go up.** `tests/ward-component-reachability.test.ts`
 * reddens if this component becomes reachable again, and that is the signal to restore cover —
 * from the record, deliberately, not by deleting a `.skip`.

/**
 * ⚠️ **NO ROUTE REACHES THE SCREEN THIS FILE RENDERS.** `EdHome` — /ed/[edId] renders EdScreen instead
 * (measured 2026-09-06, `docs/ward-flow/unreachable-ward-screens-2026-09-06.md`).
 *
 * **These cases passed and always would have. They were not coverage of anything a coordinator
 * could open.** ⚠️ **The line above this one used to say nothing here was skipped or retired.
 * That stopped being true on 2026-09-06 and is corrected rather than left standing.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS COMMENT IS A POINTER, NOT THE GUARANTEE.** A comment saying a screen is
 * unreachable stays exactly as true-looking on the day it becomes reachable again.
 * `tests/ward-component-reachability.test.ts` holds the property: it reddens if this file
 * starts rendering a newly orphaned component, AND it reddens if the component comes back,
 * naming the declaration to delete. **If the two ever disagree, believe the guard.**
