/**
 * 🔴 **RE-POINTED AT `CapacityScreen` ON 2026-09-05, AND THE RE-POINT CLOSED A LIVE HOLE RATHER
 * THAN JUST MOVING A GREEN TICK.**
 *
 * This file used to render `<WardModeWorkspace mode="capacity" />`. MERGE 02 replaced that mode
 * with `CapacityScreen` and re-pointed the route, so the mode became unreachable and this clinical
 * guard went on passing about a screen no coordinator can open —
 * `ward-mode-workspace-reachability.test.ts` is what reports that.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION — "the live screen already guards this, so just retire the file" —
 * WAS MEASURED AND IS FALSE.** `ward-capacity-screen.dom.test.tsx` carries a case named *"says who
 * confirmed each capacity figure, and never attributes a derived one to a ward"*, added during the
 * fold with a comment saying the property is "guarded here on the LIVE screen". **It cannot fail,
 * in either direction, and this was proved by mutation rather than by reading:**
 *
 *   - Its POSITIVE half asserts `toHaveTextContent(row.unit.name)` against the whole `<tr>`. The
 *     row's first cell already renders `<strong>{row.unit.name}</strong>` as the Ward column, so
 *     that assertion is satisfied by the ward's own name whatever the freshness stamp says.
 *   - Its NEGATIVE half loops over rows whose `allocatable.source !== "ward"`. **Every unit in
 *     `ward-sites.ts` seeds `allocatable.source: "ward"`** — the 23 `"feed"` values in that file
 *     are all on `empty`, a different field — so the loop iterates zero rows.
 *
 *   Two controls, 2026-09-05, source hash `51263c10` before and after each:
 *     - Deleting the attribution (`confirmedByRole={undefined}`): all 16 tests in
 *       `ward-capacity-screen.dom.test.tsx` stayed GREEN; here it fails the third case by name.
 *     - Restoring review Finding 6 itself (`confirmedByRole` unconditional AND `derived={false}`,
 *       the pre-fix state): `ward-capacity-screen.dom.test.tsx` again 16/16 GREEN; here it fails
 *       the second case by name and nothing else.
 *
 *   ⚠️ The second control had to be run TWICE. The first attempt used `perl -0pi -e` and perl
 *   interpolated `${row.unit.name}` inside its own replacement string, so the mutant that actually
 *   ran was `confirmedByRole={`NUM `}` — a different defect from the one being named. The verdict
 *   happened to be the same; the reasoning would not have been. **Read the mutated line back
 *   before believing a control.**
 *
 * **So this file is not redundant with that one; it is the only thing that can reach the defect.**
 * It mocks `useWardFlow` to construct the one state a real dispatch cannot produce — a feed-sourced
 * unit — because `CONFIRM_CAPACITY` only ever writes `source: "ward"` and no fixture seeds anything
 * else. That was this file's reason for existing against the old mode (review Finding 6) and it is
 * unchanged by the fold; only the screen under it moved.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE ASSERTIONS BELOW ARE SCOPED TO THE STAMP, NEVER THE ROW**, precisely so they cannot
 * inherit the tautology described above: `/^Confirmed /` and `/^As at /` match the freshness
 * `<span>`'s own text, which the Ward column can never satisfy.
