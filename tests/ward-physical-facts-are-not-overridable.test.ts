/**
 * ⚠️ **NO REASON TYPED INTO A FORM CREATES A BED.**
 *
 * `PULL_PATIENT` (`ward-flow-reducer.ts`) enforces two facts about the physical world —
 * `unit.allocatable.value <= 0` and `remainingSpeciallingCapacity(unit, admissions) <= 0` —
 * UNCONDITIONALLY, before it ever asks `eligibilityRefusal` for a verdict. `eligibilityRefusal`
 * returns early, allowing the placement, the instant the event carries a member of
 * `OVERRIDE_REASONS`. The doc comment on `eligibilityRefusal` is explicit that this is safe only
 * because the two physical checks run FIRST and are not reason-aware — "the moment a physical gate
 * … is added to [the overridable list], this early return silently lets a typed reason buy past
 * it, and nothing here will go red."
 *
 * Nothing before this file drove that claim through the reducer. The realistic breaking edit is a
 * tidy-up that folds the bed and specialling checks into the eligibility verdict eligibility()
 * already computes both of — which looks like a simplification and would silently let a recorded
 * reason conjure a bed.
 *
 * Each test below pairs a REFUSAL (a valid override reason against a unit with no physical room)
 * with a POSITIVE CONTROL (the identical dispatch, identical reason, against a unit that does have
 * room). Without the control, a `PULL_PATIENT` broken to refuse everything would make the refusal
 * assertion pass for the wrong reason — the property under test is that the physical fact refuses
 * even when clinical judgement is bypassed, not merely that a refusal exists somewhere.

/**
 * ⚠️ **DECIDED, 2026-09-02. THIS BLOCK WAS "UNDECIDED — A MEASUREMENT, NOT A CONTRACT" AND IS NOW
 * A CONTRACT.** It recorded that `PULL_PATIENT` never refused on a stale bed count, with a recorded
 * reason or without one — because `capacity_freshness` was not in `SUITABILITY_GATES`, so
 * `eligibilityRefusal` never reached it either way. It carried an instruction to revisit rather
 * than to endorse, and this is that revisit.
 *
 * **The owner ruled that a stale bed count IS REFUSABLE AND IS ANSWERABLE.** "I have confirmed the
 * current bed state with the ward directly" is a named person taking responsibility for a fact,
 * which is what an override reason is for. So `capacity_freshness` moved into `SUITABILITY_GATES`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE NARROW READING, RULED EXPLICITLY: this buys past a STALE COUNT, never past
 * `allocatable_bed`.** "The bed information is known to be out of date" does NOT mean "the ward
 * looks full but is not". No reason typed into a form creates a bed, and the two tests above this
