/**
 * THE COORDINATOR OVERRIDE REGISTER — and the clause that cannot be seen missing.
 *
 * Owner decision OD-3, and the requirement that makes it a governance feature rather than a log:
 * an override is **visible to the party overridden**. The ward that was referred to despite its own
 * gate failing can read that it happened, who decided it, when, and why.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AN AUDIT TRAIL AND AN ACCOUNTABILITY RECORD STORE IDENTICAL DATA.** The difference is who
 * can read it — a permission, not a schema — so a reviewer reading `Override` in `ward-model.ts`
 * sees nothing missing whichever one was built. **That is why this file exists and why the
 * assertions below are about what a ward-scoped read RETURNS and, more importantly, what it does
 * not.** An override register that only its author can see is a trail, and the decision was
 * explicitly that it is not one.
 *
 * The failure this guards against is not malice. It is the natural implementation: pass the whole
 * register to the ward screen and filter it at render. That looks identical in review, passes any
 * test asserting the ward sees its own overrides, and leaks every other ward's the moment somebody
 * adds a column, a debug panel, or a styling change that reveals a hidden row.
