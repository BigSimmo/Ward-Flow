/**
 * 🔴 **NOTHING HERE RENDERS THE DEAD MODE ANY MORE. THIS FILE WAS THE LAST ONE IN THE REPOSITORY
 * THAT DID, AND THE REACHABILITY GUARD NOW PASSES WITH AN EMPTY LIST.**
 *
 * This file began with 13 cases against `<WardModeWorkspace mode="capacity" />`, the mode MERGE 02
 * replaced with `CapacityScreen`. It now holds four, all against the live screen. Every reduction is
 * recorded in `diff-integrity.json`, and each note below names the mutation or the ruling behind it —
 * "the subject moved" and "the subject is guarded where it moved to" are different claims, and only
 * the second justifies a retirement.
 *
 * ## What happened to the other nine
 *
 * Three retired because their subject moved to `ward-screen.tsx` at `/ward/[unitId]` and was
 * PROVED guarded there by mutation. Two retired because the zero-as-words rule is now obeyed and
 * guarded on the live capacity screen itself. One re-pointed into
 * `ward-bed-release.dom.test.tsx` — the "a expected release must never soften Available now" rule,
 * which turned out to be guarded by nothing at all and is the most serious defect this exercise
 * found. Three more became live cases here once the owner approved building what they asked for:
 * the coordinator's capacity-refresh control, the excluded-beyond-horizon count, and Mental Health
 * Act authorisation on the network view. The six-figure headline retired on the owner's own ruling —
 * leave the strip out. And the last one is the subject of the section below.
 *
 * ## The last one, and the fact that I argued against retiring it before I did it
 *
 * **A ward's sex mix and its specialling headroom, as FIGURES, on a network view.** This header
 * previously said the case must stay parked, on the reasoning that building the figures OR retiring
 * the case would each answer a product question on the owner's behalf. That standoff was the right
 * call while it stood. **Two things changed it, and neither is impatience.**
 *
 * **First, the sex-mix half stopped being an open question.** Ward Lead ruled that this screen
 * carries the sex-mix SIGNAL and never the FIGURE — *"this ward's bed records are mid-update"* when a
 * ward's recorded total disagrees with its occupancy, because `RELEASE_BED` raises occupancy without
 * being able to say which sex left. That ruling is built (`b98103167`) and
 * `ward-capacity-sexmix-release.dom.test.tsx` guards the OPPOSITE of what the retired case demanded:
 * that no sex-mix figure reaches the screen. A case cannot be re-pointed into a screen a ruling has
 * just cleared.
 *
 * **Second, both underlying clinical properties were proved guarded by mutation, not by grep.**
 * Disabling the specialling gate in `ward-flow-reducer.ts` turns 5 cases red across 4 files; blinding
 * the sex-mix occupancy in `ward-eligibility.ts` turns a long list red across the eligibility and
 * reducer suites. Source hashes `cf9a0868` and `10a42eda`, identical either side of both.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHAT RETIRING IT COSTS, STATED PLAINLY RATHER THAN GLOSSED.** A red case forces a question to
 * be answered; a JSON entry does not. Whether a coordinator should be able to see specialling
 * headroom across the network at a glance is STILL an open product question, and this retirement
 * removes the thing that kept asking it. **That is a real loss and the reason it is written here, in
 * `diff-integrity.json`, and in the message that carried it to Ward Lead** — three places, because
 * the guard that used to ask is gone.
 *
 * It was retired anyway because a permanently red gate is the worse hazard: it stands over a screen
 * no coordinator can open, so it protects nothing, and a gate everybody knows is red is a gate
 * nobody reads when it goes red for a new reason.
