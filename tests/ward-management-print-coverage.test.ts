/**
 * Print-colour coverage guard for every `*.module.css` under `src/components/ward-management/**`.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. Dark mode here is a CSS CLASS (`.dark` on `<html>`, `globals.css:681`), not a media
 * query, so it stays active while printing. Under `.dark`, `--neutral-900` is near-white and
 * `--text` aliases it (as do `--text-heading`, `--text-muted`, and every themed `--ward-*` colour
 * alias declared in `ward-tokens.module.css` — `--ward-heading`, `--ward-muted`, `--ward-danger`,
 * `--ward-warning`, `--ward-success`, `--ward-blue`, all of which resolve through a token that
 * differs between `globals.css`'s light and `.dark` blocks). A colour declared on an element
 * cannot be overridden by ANY ancestor rule at any specificity, so a rule declaring one of these
 * themed colours keeps printing near-white ink on white paper unless ITS OWN `@media print`
 * reaches it — a containing screen's own reset is not enough.
 *
 * ── PART A vs PART B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This file only checks coverage; it does not decide which selector convention a fix uses. Two
 * conventions are both accepted, self-detected from the stylesheet text, no per-file config
 * needed beyond `KNOWN_UNFIXED` below:
 *
 *   1. ROOT-WILDCARD. A print rule whose selector list includes a literal `.someClass *` entry
 *      (a class immediately followed by the universal selector) is treated as a UNIVERSAL reset
 *      for the whole file: every themed-colour declaration anywhere in the file is checked
 *      against it, regardless of whether that declaring selector's text mentions the root class
 *      at all. This is a domain assumption, carried over unchanged from this guard's first
 *      version: within a single-root component, everything the file declares is assumed (by the
 *      convention the fix follows, not by anything derivable from the CSS text alone) to render
 *      as a descendant of that root. A file may declare more than one such root (`ward-sidebar.
 *      module.css` has three — the same content mounts in three different DOM locations) and
 *      each one contributes its own universal reset.
 *   2. ENUMERATION. Any OTHER selector inside an `@media print` rule that sets
 *      `color: CanvasText` is a TARGETED reset, and covers ONLY a declaring rule whose selector
 *      text is byte-for-byte identical to it. This is what makes enumeration a real commitment
 *      rather than a loophole: add a new state variant to `ward-chip.module.css` without adding
 *      its selector to the print block, and this guard fails on that exact selector — it is
 *      never covered by someone else's `.foo *` elsewhere in the same file.
 *
 * Either way `!important` (or matching/exceeding specificity — the same comparator as before)
 * is what makes a reset actually WIN, not merely exist. See "the specificity comparator itself"
 * describe block below, unchanged from this guard's first version, for why a plain `.screen *`
 * reset is not sufficient on its own: `.table td` (specificity 0,1,1) outranks `.screen *`
 * (specificity 0,1,0), and specificity is decided before source order.
 *
 * ── PART C: `composes` IS NOT AN ANCESTOR (2026-09-04) ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `ward-tokens.module.css` now carries the print reset centrally: `@media print { .wardTokens,
 * .wardTokens * { color: CanvasText !important; ... } }`. A stylesheet whose root class does
 * `composes: wardTokens from "../ward-tokens.module.css"` gets BOTH class names compiled onto the
 * SAME element — this is CSS Modules composition, not CSS inheritance — so that reset lands on
 * the very element it names, and (via `.wardTokens *`) on every descendant too. Parts A and B
 * above already covered a file's OWN `@media print` rules; this part is about resolving a
 * `composes:` line to a (stylesheet, class) pair and asking whether THAT class carries a winning
 * reset — never merely "does this file compose something."
 *
 * A `composes:` declaration is resolved to an EDGE: {composing file, composing selector, composed
 * class name, target file}. The target file's `@media print` rules are then indexed by class name
 * into two buckets — BARE (`.className { color: CanvasText ... }`, no wildcard) and WILDCARD
 * (`.className * { ... }`) — using the exact same selector-shape distinction Part A already draws
 * for local resets, just keyed by class name instead of full selector text (a composed class can
 * be attached to any selector in the composing file, so the composing file's own selector text is
 * never compared against the target's).
 *
 * COVERAGE SEMANTICS, on purpose asymmetric between ROOT and NON-ROOT:
 *
 *   ROOT composes reaching a WILDCARD target reset that wins
 *       -> blanket coverage of the WHOLE composing file. This is the same single-root domain
 *          assumption Part A's WILDCARD_RESET_SELECTOR rule already makes for a file's own
 *          `.class *` reset ("everything the file declares is assumed to render as a descendant
 *          of the root") — composing the reset in from elsewhere doesn't weaken that assumption,
 *          it just changes where the reset text lives. For the seven files this rewrite moves out
 *          of KNOWN_UNFIXED below, DOM containment was verified the same way Part A's assumption
 *          always has been: by reading the JSX and grepping the whole ward-management tree for
 *          `createPortal` (none found).
 *   ROOT composes reaching only a BARE target reset (no wildcard variant)
 *       -> covers only the composing selector's own declaration (bare `color` does not defeat a
 *          descendant's own declared `color` — only a `.class *` shape does), same as non-root.
 *   NON-ROOT composes reaching a winning reset (bare or wildcard)
 *       -> covers ONLY that element (an exact match against a declaring selector of the identical
 *          text, the same convention Part A's ENUMERATION rule already uses within one file) —
 *          NEVER the rest of the file. `ed-home.module.css` composes FOUR times: `.screen`
 *          (line 14, ROOT — the file's only wardTokens edge, in its first rule) reaches
 *          `wardTokens`'s wildcard reset and blanket-covers the file; `.populationNote` (line 83)
 *          composes `hint`, which `ward-shared.module.css` DOES reset (bare, exact) — covered, but
 *          scoped to `.populationNote` alone; `.heroBody` (line 90, composes `hero`) and
 *          `.heroFiguresGrid` (line 101, composes `heroFigures`) compose classes `ward-shared`
 *          does NOT reset at all — these two edges resolve to no coverage and contribute nothing.
 *          None of this matters to ed-home's own `declaring` list in practice (only the ROOT edge
 *          does — `.populationNote`/`.heroBody`/`.heroFiguresGrid` never declare a themed colour
 *          locally themselves), which is exactly why Mutation C below (deleting ONLY the root
 *          edge, leaving the other three composes lines intact) still turns the guard red.
 *
 *   WHAT COUNTS AS "ROOT". Never the class name (`wardTokens` is not special-cased — that is
 *   exactly the shape of trap this codebase has already been caught by twice: a class name and a
 *   token alias each defeated a name-matching detector once). A composes edge is ROOT-level iff
 *   BOTH: (a) its composing selector is the file's FIRST class-declaring rule (source order, among
 *   top-level, non-print rules), AND (b) it is the ONLY edge in the file composing that exact
 *   (class name, target file) pair. Condition (b) is the guard against a multi-root file:
 *   `ward-management.module.css` composes `wardTokens` TWICE — once on `.patientWorkspace` (its
 *   first rule) and again, separately, on `.clinicalRail` — so neither is unique, and BOTH resolve
 *   as non-root (scoped to their own selector only), even though `.patientWorkspace` would pass
 *   condition (a) alone. That file's DOM containment under a single root was never verified the
 *   way the seven target files' was, so this guard does not grant it the blanket leap — its
 *   `.rowName`/`.rowNote` composes edges (lines 781/786, composing `wardName`/`hint` from
 *   `ward-shared.module.css`) resolve covered, narrowly, and its other ~60 declaring selectors are
 *   covered only by its own pre-existing local `.patientWorkspace, .patientWorkspace *` print
 *   block — a separate mechanism this task does not touch.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE NOW WALKS DISK INSTEAD OF A HARDCODED LIST ────────────────────────────────
 * The first version of this guard hardcoded eight stylesheet paths. A later session ran it
 * against their own tree, saw none of their own files named in the output, and was one sentence
 * from concluding their files were clean. They were not — they simply were not walked. Absence
 * from a guard's output is not evidence when the guard does not walk the file. `discoverStylesheets`
 * below recurses the real directory tree every run, so a new stylesheet is checked the moment it
 * exists, with no second step to remember.
 *
 * Not every discovered file is fixed yet — most are owned by other sessions and are mid-repair.
 * `KNOWN_UNFIXED` is the explicit, TWO-SIDED record of that: `unexpectedlyBroken` catches a file
 * that should be clean and is not (a regression, or a new file nobody added to the amnesty list
 * on purpose); `fixedButStillListed` catches a `KNOWN_UNFIXED` entry that is now clean and MUST
 * be deleted from the list — the half that makes the amnesty list shrink as other sessions land
 * their fixes, instead of rotting into a permanent exemption nobody revisits. A third check
 * confirms every `KNOWN_UNFIXED` path still exists on disk, so a renamed or deleted file cannot
 * leave a stale entry granting amnesty to nothing.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS THIS GUARD MEETS (each has already produced a wrong answer in this codebase before):
 *   1. Comments are stripped before any scan — these files carry long prose comments that
 *      literally discuss `color`, `print` and `.screen` in English sentences.
 *   2. Rules are found by brace-depth parsing, tracking which are nested inside `@media print`
 *      versus outside it — a rule means the opposite thing on each side of that boundary.
 *   3. The anti-vacuity floor is on the exact collections the assertions below read: the
 *      discovered-file count (walk correctness) and the total themed-colour-declaration count
 *      across all of them (regex correctness) — not on some larger population the assertions
 *      never consume.
 *   4. Mutation-proved: see the record below.
 *
 * ── MUTATION RECORD (2026-09-04) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Proof 1 (the widened walk works): `ward-figure.module.css`'s `@media print { .figure, .figure *
 * { color: CanvasText !important; } }` block was temporarily deleted in full, confirmed different
 * from the committed file by `git diff`, and the targeted run below went RED in
 * `unexpectedlyBroken` naming `src/components/ward-management/ward-figure.module.css` (with all
 * four of its themed-colour selectors — `.figureLabel`, `.figureUnit`, `.figureSub`,
 * `.figure[data-flagged="true"] .figureValue`). The file was then restored to the exact original
 * text (not via `git checkout --`), and `git hash-object` matched `git rev-parse HEAD:<path>` —
 * both hashes are quoted in the task report.
 *
 * Proof 2 (the shrink half works): `discharges.module.css` (already fully covered, per the
 * original eight-screen fix) was temporarily added to `KNOWN_UNFIXED` below with a fabricated
 * note, confirmed different from the committed file by `git diff`, and the targeted run below
 * went RED in `fixedButStillListed` naming exactly that path. `KNOWN_UNFIXED` was then restored to
 * its exact original text and `git hash-object` matched `git rev-parse HEAD:<path>` — both hashes
 * are quoted in the task report.
 *
 * Proofs 3–5, added for the `composes` resolver (Part C above), each restored by committed blob
 * (never by reverse-replacement) with matching `git hash-object`/`git rev-parse HEAD:<path>`
 * hashes quoted in the task report:
 *   Mutation A (invents-safety direction): confirmed `ward-management-network.module.css`'s
 *   `descendantKill` edge resolves NOT covered by composition, then the resolver was temporarily
 *   broken to treat any `composes:` as covering without resolving the target — the negative
 *   control assertion went RED — then restored.
 *   Mutation B (loses-safety direction): `handover/handover.module.css`'s `composes: wardTokens`
 *   line was deleted; the guard went RED naming that file; restored from `git show HEAD:<path>`.
 *   Mutation C (the file that composes both kinds): `ed/ed-home.module.css`'s ROOT `composes:
 *   wardTokens` line (only) was deleted, leaving its three non-root composes lines intact; the
 *   guard still went RED naming `ed-home.module.css`'s seven declaring selectors, because none of
 *   those non-root edges reach them; restored from `git show HEAD:<path>`.
 *
 * WHY NOT A DOM/JSDOM CHECK. This file is `*.test.ts`, collected by this repo's "node" Vitest
 * project (`vitest.config.ts`); only `*.dom.test.tsx` gets a `document`. A literal
 * `getComputedStyle` proof was considered and rejected as impractical for this filename rather
 * than skipped — the specificity comparator is the "plain computed-specificity assertion"
 * alternative, applied to the selectors these files actually declare.

 * (whether written locally or reached through `composes:`), and that fixing it belongs to
 * whichever session owns it, not to this one (this session's mandate was exactly five
 * primitives: `ward-chip`, `ward-panel`, `ward-figure`, `ward-sidebar`, `ward-shell` — all five
 * are fixed and none appear below).
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-04 by running this file's own `discoverStylesheets` + `analyze` (now
 * `composes:`-aware — see Part C of the file doc comment above) against the tree at HEAD, then
 * listing every result with `uncovered.length > 0`. Ten entries left this map in the same sweep
 * that taught the guard to resolve `composes:`: seven (`community-home`, `community-team-hub`,
 * `community-teams-table`, `ed-home`, `ed-service-bands`, `handover`, `morning`) are now covered
 * because their root class composes `wardTokens`, which now carries the central print reset; the
 * other three (`morning-tour`, `override-register`, `ward-shared`) were fixed directly by their
 * own print blocks in the same window and never needed `composes:` at all. This list is EXPECTED
 * TO SHRINK further: as another session adds its own `@media print` coverage, `fixedButStillListed`
 * below will fail on that file's entry until it is deleted from this map. Do not add an entry
 * "just in case" — an entry for a file that is actually covered fails the guard immediately.
