 *   the 124 MB bundle test 13943 ms   and it already carries its own 300_000 override below
 *
 * So vitest's 5000 ms default was never matched to this file, and the 30_000 ms it was running
 * under was only ~3x the slowest ordinary test. With four subagents running, seven tests in this

 * a clock rather than a defect.
 *
 * 🔴 THAT FAILURE MODE IS WHY THIS IS RAISED RATHER THAN THE ASSERTIONS WEAKENED. A gate that is
 * red when the machine is busy and green when it is quiet teaches everyone to re-run it, and a
 * passing re-run is indistinguishable from a real pass. Nobody would ever again be able to tell a
 * genuine control-plane failure from a busy afternoon.
 *
 * 120_000 is ~13x the slowest ordinary test: ample headroom for load, while a genuinely hung test

     * 🔴 "EVERY REFUSAL PATH" WAS ENFORCED OVER A LIST I TYPED, WHICH IS THE DEFECT THIS TEST NAMES.
     *
     * The comment above says the realistic future edit is a fourth `fail(` added without the
     * disclosure — and a fourth `fail(` does not appear in `refusals`, so the guard would have passed
     * on exactly the edit it exists for. Complete today, and nothing kept it complete. Ward Verifier
     * found it; it is the same shape as a single-source guard keyed to a class name while claiming to
     * be keyed to a rule.
     *
     * **Floor the POPULATION, not the finding.** Counting the refusal paths in the shipped function
     * and requiring the enumeration to match means a new path goes red here until somebody adds its
     * case. Reading the function's own source is crude and it fails CLOSED, which is the direction
     * that costs a minute rather than a guarantee.

     * 🔴 **THE SNAPSHOT COMMIT IS NOT IN EVERY CHECKOUT, AND WITHOUT THIS ALL THREE CASES FAIL FOR
     * A REASON THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DISCLOSURE.** Found on CI 2026-09-06: all six
     * entries appeared in `missing` at once — every case reporting both "no disclosure" and
     * "cause was undefined" — because `assertActivationTreeSignature` calls
     * `committedTreeInputSignature(ref)` FIRST, and that throws a git error before any refusal path
     * is reached when `ref` names an object the clone does not have.
     *
     * ⚠️ **THAT IS THE NORMAL STATE ON CI FOR THIS BRANCH, NOT A FAULT.** Ward Flow publishes as a
     * rebuilt single commit with no ancestry, and CI clones shallowly, so the activation snapshot
     * this record names is genuinely absent from the tree the job checks out. Six failures that all
     * say "the disclosure is missing" while the disclosure is present is exactly the misdirection
     * this file spends two hundred lines guarding against elsewhere.
     *
     * **So the reason is ASSERTED rather than the block returning quietly** — the same treatment
     * the recovery-mode branch above gets, and for the same stated reason: a silent return reports
     * green while asserting nothing, which is indistinguishable from a guard that ran.
