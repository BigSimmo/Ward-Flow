 * OWNER RULING, 2026-09-02: a coordinator may see the suburb a referred patient is from —

 * is the catcher for that ruling on the one surface where a coordinator is actually deciding
 * where a person goes (`ShortlistPanel`), and the guard that it stays off the ward's own screen.
 *
 * `Dianella` is a real catchment suburb (`ward-catchment.ts`, row `["6062", "Dianella",
 * "Mirrabooka", 4]`) chosen deliberately: it shares no substring with any hospital, unit, or
 * emergency-department name in `ward-sites.ts`'s site register, so a text assertion for it can
 * never be satisfied by an unrelated place name the screen would show anyway (the trap
 * `ward-screen-fd23-leaks.dom.test.tsx` already documents for "Armadale" — a real suburb that is
 * ALSO a real hospital name on this fixture).

   * run on that baseline is not evidence the guard works; it is evidence there was nothing to

   * line was temporarily added to `ward-screen.tsx`'s incoming-referral card (reading the exact
   * same shared `referrals` context this suite seeds), this test was re-run and confirmed to fail
   * against that mutation, and the mutation was then reverted. The command and its failing output
   * are recorded in this task's report rather than repeated here, so a reader trusts this guard for
   * the same reason `ward-screen-fd23-leaks.dom.test.tsx`'s own "detector is proved before it is
   * trusted" test exists: an absence check that cannot fire is indistinguishable from one that
   * passes.
   *
   * The mechanism this guard actually relies on is structural, not this assertion alone:
   * `ShortlistPanel` (where the suburb is rendered) lives under `coordinator/` and nothing under
   * `ward/` imports it or the `referralForMovement`/`referralSuburbLabel` helpers it calls. This
   * test pins the observable behaviour that structure produces.
