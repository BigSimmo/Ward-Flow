/**
 * THE BOUNDARY OVER THE WARD SCREENS, AND THE TWO WAYS IT COULD BE MADE WORSE THAN NOTHING.
 *
 * Before `src/app/mockups/ward-flow/error.tsx` existed, any throw below it fell through to the
 * application shell's boundary and replaced the whole document. Ten deliberate guards live in
 * `src/components/ward-management`; one of them firing removed every patient from the screen to
 * announce that one record was wrong.
 *
 * Two properties are pinned here because NOTHING ELSE IN THE REPOSITORY CAN SEE THEM:
 *
 *   1. **The boundary must not swallow the error.** A panel reading "something went wrong" that
 *      logs nothing converts a loud failure into an invisible one — the exact inversion of the
 *      defect, and it would still look like a fix. Every gate stays green through that change.
 *   2. **An `error.tsx` must be a Client Component.** `tsc` compiles a file missing `"use client"`
 *      without complaint and every DOM test still passes; the failure appears only on a real
 *      request. That is the class of defect this repository has already shipped twice.
 *
 * The static half carries a positive AND a negative control, because a marker check that has
 * quietly stopped finding its marker reads exactly like a passing one.
