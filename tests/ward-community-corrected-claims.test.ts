/**
 * NINE CLAIMS THAT WERE FALSE ON THE COMMUNITY SCREENS, PINNED SO THAT NONE OF THEM CAN COME BACK.
 *
 * An audit on 2026-09-01 found nine statements in `community-screen.tsx` and
 * `community-derivations.ts` that were false against the model rather than merely loose. Four were
 * false because the repository had moved underneath them — the demo-clock fix (`44ca08839`) and the
 * owner's three new leaving destinations — two inverted the mechanism of a real finding, one was a
 * twin of a sentence corrected in the sibling file and left standing here, one wrote counts of a
 * seed into prose, and one made an unearned completeness claim in bold on the page.
 *
 * ⚠️ **EVERY ASSERTION HERE IS PAIRED: THE CORRECTED WORDING MUST BE PRESENT, AND THE FALSE WORDING
 * MUST BE ABSENT.** A presence pin alone survives the false sentence being added back beside the
 * true one, which is the shape these files were already in — `community-screen.tsx` carried the
 * corrected follow-up sentence while `community-derivations.ts` carried its false twin, for a day.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND EVERY ABSENCE IS PRECEDED BY A NON-VACUITY FLOOR.** A `not.toContain` passes against an
 * empty string, a renamed file read as `""`, and a mis-sliced region. The floors below are what stop
 * this file reporting itself green after the thing it scans has gone.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE RETIRED PHRASES ARE NOT REPEATED IN THE SOURCE FILES, DELIBERATELY.** Each correction
 * note in those files describes what the old sentence claimed rather than quoting it, so that the
 * absence pins below can be plain substring checks. A file that quotes its own retired false
 * sentence as history cannot be guarded this way at all.
