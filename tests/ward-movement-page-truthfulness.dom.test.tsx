/**
 * FOUR SENTENCES THIS PAGE PRINTED ABOUT PATIENTS THAT WERE NOT TRUE, AND WHY NOTHING CAUGHT THEM.
 *
 * On 2026-09-04 a reader went through ten rendered movement pages line by line — 1731 lines of
 * on-screen text — after the redesign, after `tsc`, after 400-odd unit tests and after a cold read
 * of the component. Every one of the following was live on the page at that moment:
 *
 *   WF-300  arrived and handed over, and the facts panel said the patient was in the emergency
 *           department she had left
 *   WF-008  "Bound for Maali (Ward 4.2) — open, North Metro" — Fremantle is South Metro; North Metro is
 *           where she came from
 *   WF-013  "Bound for" a ward chosen arbitrarily from two OPEN referrals, on a page that also
 *           said "Referrals still open · 2" and "No ward has accepted this patient"
 *   WF-009  "This patient's legal status has not changed since the movement opened", beside its
 *           own timeline showing an inpatient order 320 minutes after it opened
 *
 * ⚠️ THE EXISTING DOM TESTS PASS BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY ONE OF THOSE FIXES. 59 of them, over this
 * same component, none discriminating. They assert that things are rendered; none asserts that
 * what is rendered is true of the record beside it. That is the gap this file exists to close, and
 * it is why every assertion here is a property over the WHOLE fixture rather than a sentence
 * pinned to an id — a per-id assertion would go green the moment somebody edited that movement,
 * without anybody deciding it should.
 *
 * ⚠️ EACH PROPERTY CARRIES ITS OWN POPULATION FLOOR, AND THE FLOOR IS THE DENOMINATOR. The thing
 * being counted up is "movements that exercise this branch", which only grows; never "violations
 * found", which this work drives to zero and which would therefore fail exactly when it succeeded.
 * If a branch stops being exercised at all, its floor goes red and says so, because a property
 * nothing exercises is not a passing property.
