/**
 * The far-right "Who is in these beds" panel.
 *
 * **The assertion this suite exists for is the first one, and it is not about the panel's own
 * arithmetic.** The panel's sibling — the destinations panel, shipped earlier the same day —
 * was written as `arrowTargets(admissions, now)` against the whole network's 267 admissions
 * instead of one ward's eighteen, and offered "Kimberley 28 people" on a twenty-bed ward. Nothing
 * failed and nothing could have: `arrowTargets` was correct, and all nine of its assertions passed
 * because every one of them supplies its own admissions. A derivation's tests cannot see a caller
 * handing it the wrong collection.
 *
 * So the first test below asserts the thing a ward can check without a computer: the people listed
 * in this panel, plus the beds drawn as out-of-service, closed and empty, come to exactly the number
 * of beds the ward has. It runs across EVERY seeded unit rather than the one this panel was built
 * against, because the wrong-collection defect is invisible on a ward whose numbers happen to be
 * plausible and glaring on the next one along.
 *
 * Every expectation is derived from the same seed the component reads. A hand-typed "18" would be
 * a test asserting last month's ward the day an occupant is added to the fixture.

/**
 * THE OWNER DECISION THAT REVERSED, and the tests that were rewritten with it rather than deleted.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-29 `Admission` carried no diagnosis and this board printed one sentence saying so:
 * "No diagnosis is shown: this record does not hold one." The two tests here pinned that sentence
 * and pinned the ABSENCE of any per-person diagnosis row — because the risk then was a screen
 * growing an empty "Diagnosis: —" slot for a field the record did not have.
 *
 * The owner reversed the decision himself: "It can give a tentative diagnosis. This is because most
 * referrals will require a diagnosis", and "Just create broad core categories used in Australia for
 * mental health coding for now". So the record now holds `tentativeDiagnosis` — one of eleven
 * ICD-10-AM Chapter V blocks, or `null` — and this board shows it.
 *
 * **The risk moved; it did not go away, and these tests moved with it.** Three things can now go
 * wrong that could not before, and each has an assertion below:
 *
 *   1. The board shows a diagnosis WITHOUT saying it is tentative — the single most consequential
 *      misreading available on this screen, because a broad block read as settled is a clinical
 *      claim nobody made.
 *   2. A value reaches the screen that is not one of the eleven — which would mean free text had
 *      found a route in, and free text is the rule that keeps a patient's own words out of this
 *      prototype entirely.
 *   3. The unrecorded case renders as an empty slot — the ORIGINAL risk, unchanged: an em-dash or a
 *      bare label still reads as a column a ward is expected to fill in.
