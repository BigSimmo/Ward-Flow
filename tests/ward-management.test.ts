   * `DelaysScreen` and `CapacityScreen` in MERGE 01/02, and the views that held them were deleted

   * A guard reduced to an empty population reads exactly like a guard that is satisfied.
   *
   * So the property is re-pointed at the screens that actually own the tables now, and widened from
   * one file to the whole ward tree: **every `<th>` a ward component renders declares a scope.**
   * That is stronger than the original in two ways — it covers every table rather than one file,
   * and it stopped pinning a count that had already been revised three times (12 → 15 → 16) by
   * people counting columns rather than checking headers.
   *
   * `scope="row"` is accepted, not just `"col"`: `capacity-screen.tsx` has a legitimate row header
   * ("All four together", the totals row). Requiring `"col"` everywhere would forbid the correct
   * markup for a totals row — the over-broad version of this rule.
