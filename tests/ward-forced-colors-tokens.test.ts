// ⚠️ `npm run test:focused` CAN NEVER SELECT THIS FILE. It reads a stylesheet off
// disk and imports nothing from `src/`, so `vitest related` has no edge to it. A
// focused green has not run this. Run it by name, or let the full suite do it.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARDS. `src/app/ckb-v2-tokens.css` re-points 83 tokens under
// `@media (forced-colors: active)`, scoped to `.ckb-v2.ckb-v2`, and `.ckb-v2` is
// on the <html> element — so most of the ward token layer inherits high-contrast
// handling for free. Eight roles do not, because they alias tokens that block
// does not touch: the two border roles resolve to `--neutral-500` (the v2 block
// re-points `--border`, not the neutral ramp), and the six status roles resolve
// to `--success-text` / `--warning-text` / `--danger-text` and their `-bg`
// partners, which are not in it at all.
//
// The two border roles carry every panel edge and every row rule in Ward Flow.
// A screen that adopted the shared layer and deleted its own forced-colors block
// kept its text and its surfaces and lost its borders — visible only to someone
// actually running high-contrast mode, and no test in this repository renders
// under forced colours.
