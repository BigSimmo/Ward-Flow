/**
 * OWNER RULING 19 — "RECENTLY ANSWERED" HOLDS TEN.
 *
 * The section was uncapped, so "recently" decayed with use: on a busy department it would grow
 * without limit and the word in its own heading would stop being true. A clinician scanning it for
 * a mistake they made ten minutes ago would be reading a register, not a recent list.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE PROVIDER IS MOCKED, AND IT HAS TO BE.** The whole seed contains exactly TWO
 * `psychiatric_review` emergency-department destinations — one at `rph-ed`, one at `fsh-ed`
 * (`ward-movements.ts:1479` and `:1629`). No seeded state and no reachable sequence of dispatches
 * puts eleven answered referrals in front of one department, so a fixture-driven test could never
 * reach the boundary this ruling is about and would pass forever without exercising it. This
 * follows `tests/ward-capacity-freshness-source.dom.test.tsx`, which mocks `useWardFlow` for the
 * same reason and says so in the same words.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE ROWS ARE CLONED FROM A SEEDED REFERRAL, NOT INVENTED.** Hand-writing a `Referral`
 * means hand-choosing an `ageBand`, `homeRegion`, `suburb`, `source` and `urgency`, and a test that
 * invents those is a test that keeps compiling after the model tightens around them. Cloning
 * inherits every required field, so this file cannot drift from `ward-model.ts`.
