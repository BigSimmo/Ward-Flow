/**
 * The coupling between the Midland demonstration referrals (`ward-movements.ts`,
 * `MIDLAND_DEMONSTRATION_ROWS`) and the admissions they name (`ward-admissions-seed.ts`).
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS FILE IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT COUPLING CAN LIVE.** The two fixtures cannot import one
 * another — `tests/ward-flow-single-source.test.ts` allows exactly four files under `src/` to read
 * the admissions seed and `ward-movements.ts` is not one of them — so every instant in the
 * demonstration rows is a literal written against a value in the other file, and nothing in `src/`
 * can notice when one of them moves.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE PROPERTY IT GUARDS IS THE ONE `52ad01dda` GOT WRONG.** That commit populated nine
 * community team pages by pointing referrals at admissions, and every pair it produced had the
 * person in the bed BEFORE the referral existed — matched records that could not carry a duration,
 * shipped as a repair and backed out at `fa616d1c9`. The demonstration rows are the same manoeuvre
 * done deliberately; what makes them different is entirely in the timing, and timing is exactly what
 * decays silently. **If somebody later lengthens one of these stays, or shortens a lead, this file
 * is what says so.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **EVERY COUNT BELOW IS FLOORED ON THE POPULATION WALKED, NEVER ON THE VIOLATIONS FOUND.** A
 * loop over an empty array finds no violations and passes, which is how a guard over a fixture
 * quietly stops guarding it the day the fixture is renamed.
