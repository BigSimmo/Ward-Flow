/**
 * ⚠️ **THE FALSE SENTENCES THIS SURFACE CARRIED IN ITS COMMENTS, PINNED AS ABSENCES.** A comment is
 * read by a developer rather than by a clinician, which makes it less urgent and not less false —
 * and three of the four repaired here were the same defect: an unearned "every", or a count typed
 * into prose that nothing re-checks.
 *
 * ⚠️ **EVERY ONE OF THESE IS PINNED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.** A negative alone is satisfied by deleting
 * the paragraph, which loses the argument the paragraph was making; a positive alone is satisfied by
 * a file that says the new thing and the old thing at once. So each check names the retired wording
 * AND the replacement, and where the underlying fact can be measured rather than asserted — the CSS
 * class counts — it is measured from disk here rather than restated.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE NEGATIVES SCAN THE WHOLE FILE, WHICH MEANS A HISTORY NOTE MAY NOT QUOTE THE RETIRED
 * SENTENCE BACK WORD FOR WORD.** That is deliberate and it fired during this repair: two correction
 * notes quoted the false sentences verbatim and tripped their own guards. A scan cannot tell a
 * quotation from a relapse, and the alternative — carving an exemption around whatever a comment
 * calls its history section — is a guard that any future false sentence can walk through by sitting
 * in the exempt region. So the notes describe what the retired wording said instead of reprinting
 * it, and say so where they do it.

     * 🔴 WHITESPACE COLLAPSED, AND THE NEGATIVE ASSERTIONS ARE WHY.
     *
     * Prettier wraps JSX and doc-comment prose, so a sentence in the source can carry a newline and
     * indentation inside it. Matching raw text then fails in BOTH directions, and the second is the
     * dangerous one:
     *
     *   a POSITIVE assertion goes RED on correct copy — a guard calling honest prose a lie, whose
     *   obvious "fix" is to change the honest prose;
     *   a NEGATIVE assertion (`.not.toContain`) SILENTLY PASSES the moment the forbidden sentence is
     *   reflowed — so a retired unscoped absolute can come back, wrapped, and the guard reports
     *   green.
     *
     * Four of the assertions below are regression guards for absolutes this screen already had to
     * withdraw once. Every one of them was failing open. Collapsing here rather than per-assertion
     * means a caller cannot forget it.
     *
     * ⚠️ **COLLAPSING WHITESPACE ALONE IS HALF A FIX, AND THE HALF IT MISSES IS THE ONE THESE FOUR
     * ASSERTIONS LIVE IN.** Every sentence guarded below sits in a BLOCK COMMENT, and Prettier wraps
     * a block comment by starting the continuation line with ` * `. That marker is not whitespace,
     * so a plain `\s+` collapse turns the wrapped sentence into `element * here is` and the guard
     * stays GREEN. Measured, not reasoned: the retired unscoped absolute was put back into
     * `statistics-section-frame.tsx` wrapped that way, and with the whitespace-only collapse the
     * suite reported 26 passed. Stripping the continuation marker FIRST is what makes it red.
     *
     * The `\*\/?` also takes a wrapped comment TERMINATOR, so a sentence ending a doc block is
     * normalised the same way rather than keeping a trailing `/`. The pattern is anchored to
     * start-of-line so it cannot touch a multiplication, a comment opener sitting mid-line, or an
     * `import * as` — those never begin a line here, and the whole file's 26 assertions (positive
     * ones included) are the control that they do not.
     *
     * ⚠️ The floor above is calibrated on RAW length and collapsing shortens the string, so it is
     * checked before the collapse deliberately. Measured across all ten statistics sources, the
     * smallest collapses 5,701 -> 5,382, so the floor still clears with room; that is a measurement
     * rather than an assumption because an identical collapse elsewhere took 7,164 -> 1,698 against
     * a floor of 1,000.

  /*
   * 🔴 **THIS NORMALISATION REASSEMBLES COMMENTS. IT DOES NOT STRIP THEM — AND THAT IS A CHOICE
   * WITH A SHARP EDGE ON BOTH SIDES.**
   *
   * Reported by Ward Verifier after Ward Builder Two hit it in its own guard having adopted the
   * same approach. Removing the " * " continuation marker flattens a wrapped BLOCK COMMENT into one
   * clean sentence, which makes comment text MORE matchable than before the fix, not less. So:
   *
   *   a POSITIVE assertion over this output can pass because a COMMENT mentions the wording, while
   *   the screen no longer says it — a false GREEN, and invisible;
   *   a NEGATIVE assertion can go red because a comment honestly records what was withdrawn — a
   *   false RED, whose obvious fix is to delete the explanation.
   *
   * Same mechanism, opposite outcomes, and only one of them announces itself.
   *
   * ⚠️ **NEITHER IS LIVE IN THIS FILE, AND THE REASON IS WHAT MAKES IT SAFE — NOT LUCK.** Every
   * assertion here is about the SOURCE RECORD: that a correction is written down, that a retired
   * wording is absent from the tree, that a locator names a real line. **The rendered copy is owned
   * by `ward-statistics-sections.dom.test.tsx`, which reads the DOM, where a comment cannot
   * appear.** The false-green needs a positive assertion about what a SCREEN says, and this file
   * makes none.
   *
   * And the false-red is deliberate for the three retired reachability phrases below: the note at
   * that assertion argues the wording must be absent from the SOURCE too, because a record quoting
   * it back word for word puts the retired sentence into the tree in a form no scan can tell from a
   * relapse. Forbidding it outright is the decision; a comment tripping it is the decision working.
   *
   * **SO THE RULE FOR ANYONE REUSING THIS HELPER, AND IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS HERE:
   * never assert with it that a screen SAYS something.** Use the DOM test for that. If you need
   * source-matching that a comment cannot satisfy, strip comments BEFORE this marker handling —
   * outright, not reassembled — and re-run all four subjects: flat JSX prose and wrapped JSX prose
   * must be found; a sentence only in a JSX comment and a sentence only in a block comment must not.
