/**
 * 🔴 A WARD IS NEVER TOLD WHERE THE PATIENT WENT — `FD-23`, and it was being told in plain English.
 *
 * When one ward accepts, every other ward's referral is withdrawn and a `withdrawnReferrals` entry
 * records it. The reason read:
 *
 *     reason: `withdrawn — placed at ${acceptedUnit.name}`
 *
 * and the ward page renders `entry.reason` verbatim. So on the seeded fixture, at
 * `/mockups/ward-flow/ward/fsh-adult-secure`, FSH was told **"Referral withdrawn once RGH Adult
 * Secure confirmed the bed"** — the losing ward, reading the winner's name, out of the very field
 * that exists to record its own loss. Two sessions found it independently and both confirmed it on
 * screen rather than inferring it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND NO SHAPE GUARD COULD SEE IT.** `ward-referral-visibility.ts` holds a mutation-tested
 * field-set allowlist at every level and this passes every one: `reason` is a **permitted field of
 * a permitted type carrying a forbidden value.** A guard over shapes cannot see a fact smuggled in
 * prose — the same blindness that let `ALLOWED_DESTINATION_FIELDS` pass while inspecting nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ **SO THE FIX IS NOT A BETTER SENTENCE.** Sanitising the string leaves a free-form `string` that
 * any future edit can refill, with nothing red to say so. Every other reason in this model is a
 * member of a fixed list; this one was a bare `string`. It is now a union, which makes the leak
 * **unrepresentable** rather than merely absent — the same move as `edId` resolving against the real
 * network instead of being checked for non-emptiness.
 *
 * The coordinator loses nothing: it may see `movement.acceptedUnitId` directly, because it is
 * allowed to. The destination stops travelling inside a ward-readable string.

 * two-member union with two hardcoded labels and zero string interpolation, so nothing today can
 * actually produce a reason naming a site or ED — this widens the guard against a FUTURE edit
 * (a templated or free-text reason), the same way the unit check already stood watch before this
 * file existed. Do not read a red result here as an active leak; read it as the tripwire firing.
 *
