/**
 * WHICH BAND A DISCHARGE FALLS IN, ONCE THE CLOCK HAS RUN PAST MIDNIGHT.
 *
 * `releaseBand` compares a raw `Instant` against three constants — 720, 960 and 1320 — that are
 * minutes from the start of DAY ZERO. That was correct while the whole demonstration lived on one
 * synthetic day, and the function's own doc comment defends it for a real reason: a release a full
 * day out must not wrap back into an earlier band.
 *
 * The demo clock now starts at the real time of page load and runs, `ward-clock.ts` carries
 * `dayOf`, and the fixture holds people who have waited longer than a day. So the assumption those
 * three constants rest on — that every instant is a minute-of-day-zero — no longer holds, and
 * these tests are what say so out loud rather than leaving it to be discovered on a screen.
 *
 * Every case below is CONSTRUCTED at a stated instant rather than found in a fixture: the whole
 * subject is what happens at a particular hour on a particular day, and a fixture search would
 * quietly pass by finding a different case.
 */
/*
 * NO CAST. This literal was `as unknown as BedRelease` until 2026-09-02, and the cast was hiding
 * NINE discrepancies against the real type: six required fields absent (`waitingOn`, `blocker`,
 * `blockedBy`, `preparing`, `preparationNote`, `confirmedBy`) and three fields the model does not
 * have at all (`blocked`, `blockReason`, `basis`). `blocked`/`blockReason` are the pre-2026-08-28
 * shape, from when `blocked` was a fourth STATE; the field is now `blocker`, and it is the one the
 * absent/phantom pair lines up on — so this file was banding discharges on a record where a block
 * could neither be set nor read, and the system can never produce it.
 *
 * That is worse than an untidy literal. `releaseBand` is what a ward reads to plan a bed, and a
 * test that proves it against an impossible record proves nothing about the real one. Three chats
 * found this independently and none of them owned the file.
 *
 * Every field below is now supplied honestly and the compiler enforces it: add a twelfth field to
 * `BedRelease` and this stops compiling, which is exactly what the cast was suppressing. Values
 * match the established honest literal in `tests/ward-bed-availability.test.ts:15`.
