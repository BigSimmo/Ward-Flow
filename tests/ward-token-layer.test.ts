/**
 * Every guard in this file matches declaration-shaped text with a regex, and a CSS comment is
 * declaration-shaped text that declares nothing. Three such mentions exist in the ward estate
 * today — one of them inside `ward-tokens.module.css` itself, at the file's own comment about
 * `--ward-canvas: var(--surface)`. Nothing is currently fooled by them (the canonical declaration
 * comes first, and the exactly-once count runs on the pre-`@media` slice that excludes the
 * mention), so this is a latent defect rather than a live one — which is exactly when it is cheap.
 * A guard that reads prose as code fails in whichever direction the prose happens to point, and
 * the direction that stays green is the one nothing reports.
 *
 * ⚠️ This materially changes what the length floor in the exactly-once guard measures. The base
 * slice was 7,164 characters raw and is 1,698 stripped — the file is 86% comment — against a floor
 * of 1,000. It still clears it, and the floor is now a floor on actual declarations rather than on
 * prose, which is stronger. But the margin went from roughly 7x to 1.7x, so a future token removal
 * could trip it where it would not have before. Left at 1,000 deliberately: lowering it to restore
 * the old margin would weaken the only thing it checks.

 * The token layer's BASE declarations — every `@media` block stripped out.

 * 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. The uniqueness check below used to count raw occurrences
 * across the whole file, and on 2026-09-05 a `@media (forced-colors: active)`
 * block was added re-pointing eight roles to system colours. Two of them are in
 * `REQUIRED`, so the guard reported `--ward-divider declared 2 times` and went
 * red against a change that was correct.
 *
 * ⚠️ A HIGH-CONTRAST OVERRIDE IS NOT A SECOND DECLARATION. It is a conditional
 * replacement, and re-declaring the token is the only way CSS expresses one. A
 * layer that must not repeat itself in its base block must still be allowed to
 * override itself in a media block, or it can never support forced colours,
 * print or a theme at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE COUNT WAS NOT THE ONLY THING AT RISK. Anything resolving a token by
 * first textual match would have started resolving `--ward-divider` to
 * `CanvasText` and computing a contrast ratio against a system keyword. Stripping
 * the media blocks fixes both, which is why it is done here once rather than at
 * each call site.
 *
 * Fails loudly rather than silently on unbalanced braces: a strip that quietly
 * returned the whole file would restore the original defect, and a strip that
 * quietly returned nothing would make every count 0 and read as a different bug.

   *    test would never reach the contrast maths at all. Fixed by doubling the backslashes
   *    (`\\s`, `\\(`, `\\w`, `\\)`) so the intended regex actually reaches `new RegExp`.
   * 2. The plan's SURFACES list named `--ward-panel` and `--ward-sunken`, but the token file this
   *    task produces (and the plan's own "Surfaces." comment inside it) never declares those two
   *    names — it declares `--ward-ground`, `--ward-canvas`, `--ward-chrome` and `--ward-subtle`.

   * The convention that forked the leadings applies to the spacing ladder too, and the guard above

   * incident asked rather than the one the mechanism poses.
   *
   * 🔴 **THE COPY THIS GUARD WAS AIMED AT IS GONE, AND THE GUARD SAID SO ITSELF.** Until
   * 2026-09-07 `ward-sidebar.module.css` hand-copied seven `--ward-space-*` steps onto `.panel` and
   * `.drawerBody`. That copy turned out to be four COLOUR tokens short of canonical, which made
   * `var(--ward-warning)` unresolvable on the sidebar and painted an urgent chip as an ordinary one;
   * the fix was to compose the canonical layer instead of retyping part of it. The floor below then
   * fired — "this guard now proves nothing and must be re-aimed or removed, not left green" — which
   * is exactly what an anti-vacuity floor is for, and it is re-aimed rather than deleted: nothing
   * stops a future module hand-declaring a step, and this is what would catch it disagreeing.
   *
   * ⚠️ **THE FLOOR MOVED FROM THE POPULATION TO THE MACHINERY, because the population is now
   * legitimately empty.** Requiring a redeclaration to exist would require the defect to exist. What
   * can still be proved is that the walk WORKS — the same matcher, run over the canonical file it
   * normally skips, must find the whole ladder. A walk that quietly stopped matching anything now
   * fails here instead of passing over an empty tree.
   *
   * ⚠️ Scoped to the spacing family ON PURPOSE. `--ward-border`, `--ward-border-strong`,
   * `--ward-divider`, `--ward-canvas` and `--ward-table-min-width` are legitimately overridden per
   * module (a board sets its own min-width; forced-colors sets `Canvas`), and a blanket "no local
   * `--ward-*` may differ from canonical" rule goes red on more than forty deliberate declarations.
   * The first draft of this guard was exactly that blanket rule and was discarded for it. The scale
   * is the one family with no legitimate per-module variant, because a second spacing scale is the
   * thing the ladder exists to prevent.
   *
   * The floor is on the redeclarations WALKED, not on the mismatches found: a guard that quietly
   * stopped reaching the sidebar's copy would otherwise pass by looking at nothing at all.
