/**
 * WHAT THIS FILE CHECKS: for every `WardFlowEvent` union member whose body declares an
 * `overrideReason` field (derived from the AST of `ward-flow-events.ts`, never a hand-written
 * list of names), every FILE in `src/` that builds at least one object literal
 * `{ type: "<EVENT>", ... }` of that event also builds an `overrideReason` property on at least
 * one of its own construction sites for that same event type — or is named in
 * `ALLOWED_SURFACES_WITHOUT_OVERRIDE_REASON` below with a stated reason. Grouped by (file, event
 * type) rather than checked per individual call, deliberately: `shortlist-panel.tsx` has two
 * `REFER_TO_UNITS` sites, an ordinary refer (no override needed, so it rightly builds no
 * `overrideReason`) and an override submit (which does) — flagging the first as a gap would be
 * wrong, because this file demonstrably already has the capability.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHECK, AND MUST NOT BE READ AS CHECKING: whether a person using the screen
 * can actually reach a working control that records a reason. A file could pass this guard while
 * building `overrideReason` from dead code — behind a disabled flag, on an unmounted branch, in a
 * function nothing calls — and this scan would not know. Conversely a real, reachable "record a
 * reason" control that assembles the event object somewhere this scan cannot see (a shared
 * builder function called from the dispatch site, a spread from another object, a value merged in
 * by a wrapper) would fail this guard even though a user genuinely can record a reason. This is a
 * source-literal proxy for "can this surface record an override reason", not that property
 * itself.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE DERIVED SET IS ONE OF DECLARED INTENTIONS, NOT ENGINE CAPABILITIES. This derives the
 * events whose union member DECLARES `overrideReason`. That a member declares it does not mean the
 * reducer honours it — the two are joined by convention only, and THEY HAVE ALREADY DRIFTED: on the
 * master line today `ACCEPT_REFERRAL` declares the field and no reducer code reads it, because the
 * declaration was landed alone to unblock another chat while the engine half was held. So the
 * premise "declared means overridable" is falsified by a live tree, not by a hypothetical.
 *
 * The failure direction is safe — the guard would demand a control for a capability the engine
 * lacks, which generates work rather than risk. But nobody may quote the derived set as "what the
 * engine will let you override". Found by Ward Verifier. Making it mechanical (every derived member
 * must appear in a reducer call that reads `overrideReason`) is cheap and deliberately NOT built
 * yet: it would go red on master today, and that red would be a merge artefact rather than a defect.
 *
 * DO NOT CONCLUDE FROM GREEN: that the allowlisted screens are missing a control, or that the
 * non-allowlisted screens have a working one. Green only means: at the exact dispatch call site
 * this scan could see, the object literal either carries the field or the file is on the
 * accepted-gap list below.
 *
 * TWO SEPARATE GUARDS, NOT ONE: the compliance guard above answers "does every site the scan CAN
 * see meet the rule"; the coverage guard further down (`DISPATCH_CALLS_WITHOUT_A_LITERAL_TYPE`)
 * answers "can the scan see every site there is". A `dispatch({ type: cond ? "A" : "B" })` with a
 * computed type is invisible to the compliance guard's literal match by construction, not merely
 * unrecognised — so compliance alone can go green while a genuinely new override-gated dispatch
 * sits behind a ternary neither guard can read into. The coverage guard forces every non-literal
 * `dispatch(...)` call under `src/components/ward-management` into a named, human-read exception
 * list instead.
 *
 * THE CHEAPEST CHECK OF THE REAL PROPERTY, NOT BUILT HERE: a rendered-DOM/component test per
 * allowlisted surface asserting that no override-reason input exists anywhere in the tree — that
 * would need to run against the live rendered screen, not against source text, to prove the
 * "cannot yet record one" claim rather than merely record it.
