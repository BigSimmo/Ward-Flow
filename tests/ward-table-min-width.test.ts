/**
 * EVERY WARD TABLE'S SCROLL THRESHOLD, PINNED TO THE VALUE IT HAD BEFORE THE `WardTable` EXTRACTION.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Six ward stylesheets each declared their own copy of the same table
 * body, differing in exactly one live property: `min-width`, the width below which the table
 * scrolls instead of squashing. It is a fact about how many columns a screen has, not a preference.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND NOTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY ASSERTED IT.** Ward Builder Three found the gap while
 * characterising the six variants, and named the part that makes it dangerous: *its own sweep tool
 * does not check `min-width` either.* So a module migrated onto the shared block **without** its
 * threshold carried across is green in every instrument the project has — the table silently stops
 * scrolling and starts squashing, on a screen a coordinator reads under pressure, and no test, no
 * gate and no sweep says a word. That is the likeliest silent regression in the whole extraction,
 * which is why the guard is written rather than the value merely reported.
 *
 * **The property asserted is the EFFECTIVE THRESHOLD, not how it is spelled.** A module satisfies
 * this whether it declares `min-width: 30rem` directly (pre-migration) or sets
 * `--ward-table-min-width: 30rem` for the shared block to consume (post-migration). That is
 * deliberate: the extraction is landing module by module, and a guard that demanded one spelling
 * would be red for every module not yet migrated and would have to be edited as each one lands —
 * which is a guard that gets relaxed rather than one that holds.
 */

/*
 * A THRESHOLD BELOW A TABLE'S INTRINSIC MINIMUM IS INERT, AND LOOKS IDENTICAL TO A WORKING ONE.
 *
 * Ward Builder One measured this on the running page, 2026-09-05, and found it in its own work: it
 * had written `30rem` for the compare screen's department table. That table's intrinsic minimum and
 * its max-content width are the SAME 36.53rem, because every cell is a nowrap header or a short
 * figure and nothing can wrap. **So 30rem could never take effect.** It is indistinguishable from a
 * working threshold in the stylesheet, in this pin file, and on the page at every width above it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT SEE. It asserts a threshold has not silently CHANGED - which is
 * worth having and is what it was built for. **It cannot tell an effective threshold from an inert
 * one**, because that needs a table's intrinsic minimum, which needs a browser, which no offline
 * guard has.
 *
 * SO THE HONEST STATE OF THIS MAP, kept current as entries are measured rather than left to
 * describe the day it was written: the queue's 46rem, the compare screen's two, and — added at the
 * merge that brought this comment onto that branch — `referrals`, measured at a 641px viewport
 * against a 499px scroller by the same method, after 40rem was found putting two columns of each
 * board table off the screen. **RE-MEASURED 2026-09-12 and moved to 33rem — see the entry below;
 * the 30rem this sentence used to name had itself gone inert on the queued table in between.** The
 * rest are read out of stylesheets. **If a threshold was chosen by eye rather than measured, it
 * may be inert and nothing here will ever say so.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND A SENTENCE THAT COUNTS THIS FILE'S OWN MEASURED ENTRIES GOES STALE THE NEXT TIME
 * SOMEBODY MEASURES ONE.** It said "one entry" and was already wrong about its own file by the
 * time the two branches met — not through carelessness, but because a hand-maintained tally of a
 * list sitting six lines below it has no way to notice the list moving. It is kept as a NAMED
 * list rather than a count for that reason: adding a name is a thing the next person will
 * actually do, and "one entry" is a thing they would have had to notice was wrong first.** That is not a defect in the pins; it is the boundary of what a text-reading guard can
 * assert, written down so a green is not read as "these thresholds work".
 *
 * A cheap way to check one, for anyone with the dev server up: neutralise the table's own
 * `min-width`, let the wrapper size to content, and compare the table's intrinsic minimum with the
 * declared threshold. If the threshold is the smaller number, it does nothing.

 * first characterisation of these files. `null` means the module deliberately declares no
 * threshold.
 *
 * ⚠️ A CHANGE TO ONE OF THESE NUMBERS IS A DESIGN DECISION ABOUT A SPECIFIC SCREEN. It is not a
 * merge artefact and it is not tidying. If a screen gains or loses columns the number moves — but it
 * moves in a commit that says which screen and why, which is the whole point of pinning it.

 * satisfied the discovery check below while leaving the other completely unwatched, **and the map

   *
   *     1200-888px   table height 1363px   uncompressed, dead flat across 312px of width
   *     886px                              first growth: THE KNEE, 888px = 55.5rem

   *     870px below  2137px                +57%

   *     450px below  4981px                floors out at 3.7x uncompressed
   *
   * RULED: 46rem STANDS. The finding is not "46rem is wrong" — the token is a deliberate tolerance
   * for wrapping, and the sweep's other result is what settles it: **no cell overflows at ANY width
   * down to 300px, at every step.** This table degrades by WRAPPING, never by clipping, so below the
   * threshold the failure mode is a tall table and not hidden content. Raising the threshold to the
   * knee would force horizontal scrolling onto more screens to buy a shorter table, and content is
   * never lost either way. **A tall table on a phone beats a sideways-scrolling one.**
   *
   * ⚠️ The property worth caring about is the one the sweep found for free — degrades by wrapping,
   * not by clipping — rather than the pixel. If a future change makes this table clip, the number
   * stops being a tolerance and becomes a defect.
   *
   * Caveats kept, because a measured number travels further than its caveat: one page, one browser,
   * default font and zoom, width applied to the wrapper rather than the viewport (so page chrome is
   * excluded), and 43 SEEDED rows — a longer value in real data moves the knee right, never left.
   *
   * EVERY OTHER NUMBER IN THIS MAP IS STILL A STYLESHEET READING, not a measurement.
   *
   * The original note, kept because the reasoning for pinning an unverified value still holds:
   *
   * PROVISIONAL, AND SAID SO RATHER THAN LEFT OUT. QueueView's table was rebuilt on the primitive
   * at `120855dea`, and its implementer flagged this number as its own unverified estimate: this
   * codebase's convention treats a scroll threshold as trustworthy only after real-browser
   * measurement, which was outside that task's proof list.
   *
   * PINNED ANYWAY, because pinning means "this must not change silently", not "this is correct".
   * An unpinned seventh table would make a six-entry map read as "these are the ward tables" when
   * there are seven — the same way an emptied allowlist read as "the estate is clean" a few hours
   * ago. When somebody measures it at 375px and it turns out wrong, this line goes red, which is
   * exactly the conversation that should happen.

   *
   * ⚠️ **RE-MEASURED THE SAME DAY, AND THE FIRST FIGURE WAS ALREADY STALE.** It was 50.5rem, above
   * a max-content of 50.06rem, correct for a SIX-column table. `Empty-bed time` was then removed
   * on Ward Lead's ruling — it was arithmetically incapable of varying — and the five-column table
   * measures **37.82rem, with max-content and intrinsic minimum equal**, because every cell is a
   * nowrap header or a short figure and nothing in it can wrap.
   *
   * **A pin left at 50.5rem would not have been inert. It would have been WORSE than inert:** a
   * third wider than the table needs, forcing a horizontal scroll where none was required and
   * pushing columns off the visible scroller at widths where they would otherwise have fitted.
   * **An over-pin is invisible in exactly the same places an under-pin is** — the stylesheet reads
   * as deliberate, this map reads as measured, and the page looks fine at desk width. So 38rem,
   * just above the measured 37.82rem. **A threshold measured against a table that has since
   * changed shape is not a measurement any more.**
   *
   * ⚠️ **AND IT WENT STALE A SECOND TIME THE SAME DAY, FROM A CHANGE THAT WAS NOT ABOUT WIDTH AT
   * ALL.** Pinning the identity column released `white-space: nowrap` on the row headers so a
   * service's full name could wrap; max-content fell from 37.82rem to 34.82rem, and 38rem became an
   * over-pin again. **Three stale readings in one day, every one of them correct when taken, none of
   * them wrong through carelessness** — a column removed, then a wrapping rule relaxed. Nothing in
   * this repository connects a table's SHAPE to the pin that was measured for it, so the same
   * hazard sits on every row of this map.
   *
   * ⚠️ THIS FILE DECLARES TWO THRESHOLDS AND THIS MAP CAN PIN ONE PER FILE. The second is the
   * department table at 27.5rem, and it is NOT pinned here. It is named rather than left silent:
   * `thresholds()` returns both, and the assertion below is `found.includes(expected)`, so the
   * unpinned one can change without going red. If a second statistics table is worth pinning, this
   * map's shape has to change first — which is a decision, not an edit I should make while adding
   * a row to it.
   *
   * ⚠️ AND THE DEPARTMENT TABLE IS WHY MEASURING MATTERS RATHER THAN ESTIMATING. It was written
   * as 30rem, and 30rem was INERT: that table's intrinsic minimum and its max-content width are the
   * same 36.53rem, because every cell is a nowrap header or a short figure and nothing in it can
   * wrap. A threshold below a table's own minimum changes nothing, and looks identical to a working
   * one in the stylesheet, in this map, and on the page at any width above it.
   *
   * ⚠️ IT WENT STALE A THIRD TIME, AND THE NARRATIVE ABOVE NEVER RECORDED IT: the ward table's pin
   * was tuned once more that same morning, from 38rem to 35rem, and this map was updated to match
   * without a fourth paragraph being added here. **RE-MEASURED 2026-09-12**

   * The ninth is `ward-management-modes.module.css`'s `.dataTable` at 48rem.

   * ward tables' when there are seven."* The worry was written down, correctly, and then a ninth
   * arrived and nothing went red — because **a worry in a comment is not a check.** The list looked
   * exhaustive, every assertion over it passed, and the one thing nobody was asked was whether the
   * list was the estate.
