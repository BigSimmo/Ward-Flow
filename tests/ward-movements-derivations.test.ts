// The merged Movements screen (MERGE 03) answers "where is each patient in their move, and what is
// carrying them" — `journeyStages` for the first half, `transportLegs`/`transportCounts` for the
// second. Design lock: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-ward-flow-merges-1-3-design-lock.md §5.
//
// Every test here walks the real `wardMovements` fixture unless the behaviour under test has zero
// occurrences in it (an empty stage, an expiring legal authority, a transport job nobody has
// accepted yet) — measured directly against the fixture on 2026-09-05, not assumed. Those three
// cases use a small, explicitly-labelled synthetic movement built from a real one via
// `structuredClone`, never a hand-typed literal that could drift from the real `Movement` shape.

 * the comparison compared a quantity with itself. **No test over real `Movement` data could ever
 * have reached it** — a safeguard indistinguishable from one that does not work, and one a refactor
 * would have deleted unmissed.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND WHAT IT DEFENDS AGAINST IS NOT WHAT MY COMMENT SAID.** Not a new stage — `abandoned`
 * enumerates no stages and catches every non-arrived one that will ever exist. It defends against a
 * future narrowing of `isOpen`, which would grow `total - open` past `arrived + abandoned`.
 *
 * Splitting the arithmetic out is what makes that testable without injected predicates.
