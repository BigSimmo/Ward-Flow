/**
 * 🔴 **EVERY WARD SCREEN MUST SAY ITS DATA IS INVENTED, AND THREE OF THEM DID NOT.**
 *
 * Found 2026-09-06 by walking the running app rather than by reading code. `/mockups/ward-flow/capacity`
 * showed 303 beds, 43 waiting patients and twenty-three named Perth hospitals with **nothing on the
 * page saying any of it is fictional**; `/mockups/ward-flow/movements` showed fifty patient journeys
 * with the same silence. Twenty-four other ward screens carried the badge.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE CAUSE IS THAT IT IS OPT-IN PER SCREEN.** There is no shared component and no layout
 * providing it — every screen renders its own `<span className={styles.prototypeBadge}>`. So a
 * screen built after the convention was set gets none by default, and **the three that were missing
 * it are exactly the three screens the 2026-09-05 merges created** — capacity, delays and movements.
 * Nothing reported it, because nothing asked.
 *
 * ⚠️ **I REPORTED THE WRONG SET TWICE BEFORE THIS, IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.** First I grepped the
 * rendered pages for "not a real medical device" and got SIX missing — a phrase only one screen
 * uses, so four were false. Then I grepped for "Synthetic prototype" and got TWO — because Next
 * streams the page's `<meta name="description">` into the BODY, and three of those descriptions
 * contain the phrase, so `/delays` looked disclosed while showing nothing. **Both sweeps searched
 * the page source; neither measured what a reader sees.** Settled by parsing the document, deleting
 * head/meta/script/title, and reading the remaining text — which agrees with this guard exactly.
 * That is why this scans for the MECHANISM rather than for any phrase.
 *
 * This walks routes rather than components on purpose: a component nothing routes to cannot show a
 * disclosure to anybody, and a route is what a reader actually opens.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NO FOCUSED RUN CAN EVER SELECT THIS FILE, SO DO NOT TRUST ONE OVER IT.** `npm run
 * test:focused` selects by `vitest related`, which walks the IMPORT GRAPH — and this file imports
 * `node:fs` and `vitest`, nothing else. Adding a ward screen with no disclosure therefore changes
 * no file this guard imports, and a focused run over that change reports green having never loaded
 * it. **The same is true of `ward-nav.test.ts` and `ward-mode-workspace-reachability.test.ts`**, the
 * other two guards on this branch that read the repository rather than importing it.
 *
 * **That is not hypothetical here.** On 2026-09-06 a change on this branch added a third builder of
 * the `/ward/[unitId]` route; the delays, capacity, landmarks and route-binding suites were all run
 * and all green, and `ward-nav.test.ts` — which no run had selected — sat red for three commits.
 *
 * Making this file import a component to get itself selected would be worse than the gap: it would
 * tie a whole-repository walk to whichever one component it happened to import, and `related` would
 * still miss every change to the other twenty-odd. **The honest mitigation is a full run before a
 * fold, which matters more here than in most of the repository because this branch never reaches
 * CI — a local `vitest run --dir tests` is the ONLY thing that ever executes this guard.**

/**
 * 🔴 **COMMENTS ARE REMOVED BEFORE ANY QUESTION IS ASKED OF A FILE, AND WITHOUT THIS THE GUARD WAS
 * DECIDED BY THE WORDING OF A COMMENT RATHER THAN BY WHAT THE SCREEN RENDERS.**
 *
 * Proved on the live tree, 2026-09-06, by deleting the badge from `capacity-screen.tsx` twice:
 *
 *     badge removed, comment left saying "the prototypeBadge span was removed here"  -> 2 PASSED
 *     badge removed, comment saying "the synthetic-data badge span was removed here" -> 1 FAILED,
 *                                                                 naming capacity -> CapacityScreen
 *
 * Identical code, identical missing disclosure on a page showing 303 beds and twenty-three named
 * Perth hospitals; the verdict turned on whether a comment happened to contain the class name. And
 * it is not hypothetical: `statistics/statistics-disclaimers.tsx` already mentions `prototypeBadge`
 * in prose and nowhere in code, so the satisfying text is in the tree today.
 *
 * ⚠️ **IT FIXES A SECOND HOLE OF THE SAME SHAPE THAT NOBODY HAD LOOKED FOR.** `disclosesWithin`
 * finds a component's children by scanning for `<Tag`, so a COMMENTED-OUT child element counted as
 * rendered — a route could inherit its disclosure from a component it no longer draws.
