/**
 * THE ONE TEST THAT READS AN EXPLANATION.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHY IT EXISTS.** Seven statements the statistics and community screens make about the data
 * model were found false on 2026-09-01. Every one passed the entire suite; every one was found by a
 * person reading. Nothing in a test suite can check that a sentence is true — but it CAN check that
 * the source line the sentence was written from still says what it said. That is what this file
 * does, and it is the whole of what it does.
 *
 * ⚠️ **EVERY CITATION IS RESOLVED AGAINST THE REAL FILE, READ FROM DISK HERE.** Nothing is compared
 * against a copy held in the register. A copy cannot go stale, so a register of copies would be
 * green forever and worth nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ **EXACTLY ONCE, NOT "CONTAINS".** A citation that matches twice no longer identifies a unique
 * fact — the reader following it lands on two different lines and has to guess which one the claim
 * meant. That is its own failure with its own message, distinct from "gone".
 *
 * ⚠️ **EVERY FAILURE NAMES THE CLAIM, NOT THE STRING.** A red reading "expected 1, got 0" over a
 * forty-character fragment tells the next person nothing. The messages below lead with the claim id
 * and the claim in words, so the question a reader is left with is "is that still true?", which is
 * the question worth asking.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND SINCE 2026-09-01 IT ASKS THE QUESTION THAT MATTERS: WOULD THE CLAIM'S FALSITY MOVE THE
 * CITED BYTES?** Presence is not connection. An audit put every citation in the register to that
 * test and twelve failed it — a doc comment restating its own claim, a two-field slice cited for an
 * "only", four figures claimed to be DERIVED while citing their type declaration, a signature cited
 * for a behaviour `?? fallback` would change without touching it. Each was present, unique, and
 * gave the right answer, and not one of them would have stopped giving it. So every claim now
 * carries a `falsifiedBy` edit, this file applies it to an IN-MEMORY copy of the source, and the
 * evidence must then be GONE. Nothing is written to disk and nothing is executed.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHAT THIS CANNOT CATCH IS WRITTEN OUT IN THE REGISTER'S OWN DOC COMMENT**, and this file
 * deliberately does not restate it. The short version: it cannot catch a claim that was wrong the
 * day it was written and cited correspondingly wrongly, it cannot witness an absence at all, and it
 * cannot tell a genuine falsifying edit from a misleading one an author wrote to get past this
 * check. `UNEVIDENCED_CLAIMS` carries the absences by name so the gap is countable.

/**
 * ⚠️ **A CITATION THAT IS NOTHING BUT A COMMENT CANNOT WITNESS ANYTHING, AND THE REGISTER HAS ALREADY
 * SHIPPED ONE.** Read this before deciding the rule is pedantic.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-01, `community-index/enumeration/a-team-name-is-what-a-referral-stores` cited the
 * doc comment beside the field — "Exactly the string a referral stores in `teamName`. Never composed
 * or prettified here." — as evidence for the claim that a team's name is never composed or
 * prettified. The two say the same thing in the same words, which is exactly the problem. Compose
 * the name, title-case it, add a prefix: the comment sits precisely where it is, the citation stays
 * green, and the page goes on telling a reader something that is no longer true. The ONLY edit that
 * broke that citation was DELETING the comment — and deleting a comment is the one action that does
 * not make the claim false.
 *
 * The property every citation must have is not length and not specificity. It is: **would the
 * claim's falsity change the cited bytes?** Code that produces or consumes the value has that
 * property. Prose describing the code does not, because prose is not what changes when behaviour
 * changes.
 *
 * If a claim genuinely rests on a convention with no mechanism behind it, that is an honest answer
 * and it belongs in `UNEVIDENCED_CLAIMS` with the reason — not in `MODEL_CLAIMS` with a comment
 * standing in for evidence.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ⚠️ **THIS RULE IS NO LONGER LOAD-BEARING, AND ITS HOLES ARE WRITTEN DOWN RATHER THAN PATCHED.**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The falsifying-edit check further down is the guard now. This one is kept as a cheap fast-fail
 * with a clearer message, because a citation that IS a comment has a much better error to give than
 * "your evidence survived its own falsifying edit". Two holes, both real, neither patched:
 *
 *   1. **It only inspects the citation's OPENING character.** A slice cut to begin on the second
 *      line of a doc comment never matches, and a slice cut from the middle of a single-line comment
 *      never matches either. Three citations walked straight through it — the null-referral-id one
 *      opened with a `*` continuation mid-string, the ED-verbal one opened with a backtick.
 *   2. **Its code-token test passes almost any real doc comment.** `[;{}=()[\]]` or a bare `word:`
 *      is enough, and prose containing a parenthesis, a `Note:` or a `Reason:` has one. The single
 *      rejection case below is, by coincidence, the one prose comment in this repository that
 *      contains none of them.
 *
 * **Tightening the character test was considered and rejected**: it is a better heuristic about
 * characters when characters are not the property, and every version of it still loses to a slice
 * cut from the middle of a single-line comment. What WOULD close it exactly is locating the
 * citation's match index in the file and testing whether it falls inside a block comment or a
 * `//`-to-newline span — no heuristic, no evasion. That is not built here because it needs a real
 * tokeniser to be correct (a regex literal desynced this repository's last hand-rolled comment
 * scanner — see `tests/ward-flow-single-source.test.ts`, which moved to the TypeScript AST for
 * exactly that reason), and because it would be buying a second guard for a case the first one
 * already reports.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE FALSIFYING-EDIT CHECK DOES NOT FULLY SUBSUME THIS ONE — SAY SO RATHER THAN IMPLYING
 * IT DOES.** For a comment citation an author can record `find: <the comment>, replaceWith: ""` and
 * the evidence duly disappears, so the check passes mechanically. What it cannot do is hide: the
 * edit's `change` field has to say, in the register, in words, that the change to the world is
 * "the comment is deleted" — which is visibly not a change to the world at all. The defect moves
 * from invisible to written down, which is the whole of what this repair claims.

/**
 * ⚠️ **THE CHECK THIS FILE GAINED ON 2026-09-01, AND THE ONE THAT ASKS THE RIGHT QUESTION.**
 *
 * Every other check here asks whether the cited bytes are PRESENT. Presence and connection are not
 * the same thing: a citation can be present, unique, and give the right answer today while nothing
 * about it tracks the fact it stands for. Twelve of this register's citations were in exactly that
 * state — right by accident. So the register now records, for each claim, the change to
 * `sourceFile` that would make the claim FALSE, and this applies it to an in-memory copy and
 * demands the evidence has gone.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A CITATION THAT IS RIGHT BY ACCIDENT IS REJECTED, AND THAT IS THE POINT RATHER THAN
 * OVER-STRICTNESS.** "It works today" is not the property being guarded. "It would stop working if
 * the claim stopped being true" is.
 *
 * Three failures are distinguished, because they call for three different fixes:
 *
 *   - `anchor-missing` / `anchor-ambiguous` — the EDIT has gone stale, not the citation. Without
 *     this, an edit that matches nothing would apply nothing, leave the evidence in place, and be
 *     indistinguishable from an unfalsifiable citation.
 *   - `no-op` — `replaceWith` equals `find`, so the "edit" changes nothing and the check cannot
 *     fail. That is the shape of every dead guard this project has found.
 *   - `evidence-survives` — the real finding. The claim can become false with every cited byte
 *     still in place.
 *
 * Nothing is written to disk. This is one `split`/`join` and one `includes` per claim.

/**
 * 🔴 **WHAT THE FALSIFYING EDIT DOES AND DOES NOT CLOSE ABOUT COMMENTS. MEASURED, BOTH DIRECTIONS.**
 *
 * `readRepoFile` collapses whitespace and strips NOTHING, so every check here matches against a
 * source in which comments are ordinary text. The obvious conclusion is that a comment can satisfy
 * any of them. **That conclusion is half wrong, and the half that is wrong is not the half that
 * matters.**
 *
 * | the comment | result |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | evidence copied into a comment BESIDE the live code | RED (`anchor-ambiguous`) |
 * | watched code COMMENTED OUT, or deleted with a doc comment describing it | 🔴 **GREEN** |
 *
 * **Why the copy case is closed structurally rather than by luck.** A claim can only pass in the
 * first place when its anchor lies INSIDE its own evidence — an anchor elsewhere in the file
 * returns `evidence-survives`. So any faithful copy of the evidence necessarily duplicates the
 * anchor, and `anchors > 1` is reported before anything else is considered. That is a real
 * property of requiring a falsifying edit, and it holds without this file parsing the source
 * correctly, or at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The green row is the one that actually happens.** Nobody writes prose that accidentally
 * matches a citation. People comment a line out with a note saying why — an ordinary, careful,
 * well-mannered act — and then `anchors` stays 1, because the only occurrence in the file is now
 * inside that comment. The falsifying edit rewrites the comment, the evidence disappears, and no
 * problem is reported. Both variants were tried: the line commented out in place with a "removed,
 * see ruling" note, and the code deleted with a doc comment saying the derivation historically
 * classified this way. Both green.
 *
 * `isEntirelyComment` does not save it. That asks whether the **claim's evidence string** opens as
 * a comment, never whether the **match site** does, so code-shaped evidence walks past it — which
 * is the same hole its own header already writes down, seen from the other end.
 *
 * ⚠️ **So never write "we tested comments and it holds."** It is true of the case somebody
 * considered and false of the case that occurs. Say which direction was tested.
 *
 * HOW THIS WAS ESTABLISHED, because it bears on the next such question: `falsifiabilityProblem`,
 * `collapseWhitespace`, `countOccurrences` and `isEntirelyComment` are pure functions of a source
 * STRING. They were copied out and run over synthetic sources, control green and known-bad red, so
 * nothing in the repository was mutated and no shared file was put in a broken state to learn this.
 * **Before deciding a mutation is too risky to run, check whether the thing under test is a pure
 * function.** A surprising amount of guard machinery is.
