/**
 * TWO CLOCKS, AND THE SECOND ONE IS ALLOWED TO NOT EXIST.
 *
 * `P9-D2` (OWNER, 2026-08-30): every wait carries **two** clocks, both visible — time in the
 * department, counted from triage, and time since the referral to mental health. **The gap between
 * them is the signal**: it says whether the delay sits upstream of mental health or with them,
 * which one clock can only ever obscure. He rejected referral-only (a patient sits for hours before
 * anyone refers, and the screen shows a short wait) and triage-only (mental health looks slow for
 * a delay it could not act on).
 *
 * `P9-D7`: a **community expect who has not arrived has only ONE clock**, and the screen must say
 * so. Time in department does not exist for them yet, and it must render as genuinely absent —
 * ⚠️ **not `0m`, not an em dash styled like a duration, and never a zero that sorts alongside real
 * waits.** *"A not-yet-arrived expect showing '0m in department' reads as 'just arrived', which is
 * the opposite of the truth."*
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE MODEL COULD NOT EXPRESS ANY OF THAT UNTIL NOW — `P9-F3`.** `P9-D7` was recorded against
 * a `Referral` with no arrival instant at all, so the ruling had **no field to read**: settled in
 * the register and unbuildable from the code, with neither side announcing the disagreement. This
 * file is the other half of closing that, and every assertion below is one of those two rows.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND `triagedAt` IS NOT THE `arrivedAt` PHASE 8 TASK 2R DELETED.** That one meant arriving at
 * a **bed**, and it went because `Admission` is the single record of a person occupying one. This
 * is entering the **department** — a different event, at a different place, starting a different
 * clock, for a person who may never get a bed at all. Naming it `arrivedAt` again would have made
 * the deletion look reversed rather than complemented; see `Referral.triagedAt`'s own comment.
 *
 * ⚠️ **TRIAGE IS A PROXY FOR ARRIVAL, NOT ARRIVAL.** A patient arrives, waits, and is triaged some
 * time later; on a busy night that gap is not small. The arithmetic is unaffected and **the wording
 * is not** — the last test in this file fails on any clock term containing "arriv", because the
 * first version of this work was named honestly and commented dishonestly, and it was the comment
 * that would have reached the screen.
