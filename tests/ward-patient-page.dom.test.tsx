/**
 * Task 10 (spec item 8). The patient page showed the legal form but not three records the
 * binding spec requires: declines, status/urgency changes, and the escalation record.
 *
 * WF-009 is the fixture's one movement carrying an escalation and its five declines (measured
 * against `ward-movements.ts` directly). WF-010 is the fixture's one movement carrying a
 * hand-authored `statusChanges` entry. Neither carries a hand-authored `urgencyChanges` entry —
 * every fixture movement seeds that array empty — so the urgency-change half of the "changes"
 * section is proven by dispatching a real `CHANGE_URGENCY` event against WF-010 (same technique
 * as `tests/ward-screen.dom.test.tsx`'s `ReferWF301ToRphAdultSecure`: a real reducer dispatch,
 * not a hand-edited fixture), rather than weakening the assertion to skip that half. WF-001
 * carries none of the three records and is not closed, so it is the empty-state case.
