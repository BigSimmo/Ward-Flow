/**
 * 🔴 `initialNow` WAS ACCEPTED AND ITS VALUE WAS NEVER USED.
 *
 * The prop was read three times — `!== undefined` in each — to choose the pinned path: offset zero,
 * no tick interval, no wall-clock read. **The number itself went nowhere.** So a caller pinning the
 * clock to any instant other than `NOW_ANCHOR` silently got `NOW_ANCHOR`, with nothing red.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NOTHING WAS WRONG THE DAY IT WAS FOUND, AND THAT IS THE POINT.** Every call site passes
 * `NOW_ANCHOR` or `WARD_ADMISSIONS_ANCHOR`, and those two constants are both `10*60+42` — so the
 * ignored value happened to equal the value used. **The seed-default class with the trigger not yet
 * pulled.** Reported by Ward Referrals as five test files.
 *
 * **Counted at `699cc3586`, the commit before this docblock existed: 85 `initialNow=` call sites in
 * 38 files; 109 occurrences of the identifier in 42 files; 5 call sites passing
 * `WARD_ADMISSIONS_ANCHOR`.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE SHA IS LOAD-BEARING, BECAUSE THIS PARAGRAPH IS INSIDE THE THING IT COUNTS.** Writing "85"
 * down made it 86: the sentence above contains `initialNow=`, so the record of the measurement is
 * counted by the measurement. Re-run the grep today and you get 86 and 110, off by exactly one on
 * each total while the file counts stay at 38 and 42 — because this file already held the token, so
 * the drift shows on one axis and not the other and survives a sanity check. Caught by a third
 * session that re-measured before accepting the correction and traced a consistent off-by-one to
 * its cause rather than dismissing it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **ONE is the dangerous size.** Off by fifty reads as a bug and gets investigated; off by one
 * reads as carelessness and quietly discredits an exact record.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE TWO ERRORS CANCEL, WHICH IS WHY BOTH HALVES OF THIS ARE LOAD-BEARING.** Measured
 * across all three trees under both units:
 *
 * ```
 *              matches (-o)   lines with a match (-c)   files
 *  699cc3586       109                 107               42     <- where the 109 was taken
 *  416fb1e48       110                 108               42
 *  d8cc6c628       111                 109               42     <- today
 * ```
 *
 * Run the WRONG flag on the WRONG tree today and you get **109** — the exact figure pinned above.
 * So a reader verifying this line with `git grep -c` right now confirms it, is wrong twice over, and
 * nothing about that check feels weak from the inside. It is structural rather than a fluke: the
 * tree drifts by one per commit mentioning the token and the two units differ by a small constant,
 * so the quantities cross regularly, and they will cross again on any long-lived count.
 *
 * **The SHA kills the wrong-tree half and naming the unit kills the wrong-measure half. Either alone
 * still admits the cancelling pair.** Found by the session that re-measured a correction it had
 * already been told was exact.
 *
 * Two repairs were offered — say that it counts itself, or exclude this file from the pattern.
 * Neither is taken. The first leaves a number any later edit still invalidates; the second tunes the
 * measurement so the record fits, which is the wrong direction. **A figure stamped with the tree it
 * was taken on cannot be contradicted by a later edit at all**, which is what an observation with a
 * shelf life actually needs.
 *
 * ⚠️ And my first report of this said "roughly eighty-five across thirty-five files" — the 85 was
 * exact and the 35 was not (38), and by the time a third session came to file it both the word
 * "roughly" and my name had been dropped in one hop. **A relayed number arrives already believed,
 * and the relay erases the one thing that would prompt anyone to check it.** A number that turns out
 * right by luck teaches the wrong lesson about how it was obtained.
 *
 * The fix treats the pinned and live paths the same way: the anchor offset is *the now we want*
 * minus `NOW_ANCHOR`, whether that now comes from the prop or from the wall clock. Passing exactly
 * `NOW_ANCHOR` is offset zero, which is byte-for-byte today's behaviour, which is why no existing
 * suite moves.
