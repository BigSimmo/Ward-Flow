/*
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Owner ruling, 2026-09-01, and the definition matters more than the rule:
 *
 *   "Community referral means a patient is about to be discharged... go ahead with your
 *    recommendation and stop cancelling them"
 *
 * A community referral does NOT compete with a bed. It means the patient is on their way OUT. So
 * `ACCEPT_REFERRAL` cancelling it because a ward said yes is the app cancelling DISCHARGE PLANNING at
 * the moment admission is confirmed, which is exactly backwards.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DEFECT WAS INVISIBLE, WHICH IS THE FRAGILE KIND OF CORRECT. `admissionBelongsToTeam` reads a
 * destination's kind and team name and never its state — deliberately, with its own comment saying a
 * cancelled referral still named that team. So nothing displayed the wrongful cancellation. Anyone
 * later "tightening" the hub to respect state would have made it live and people would have vanished
 * from team pages. This fixes the cause; a sibling test pins the hub's blindness so the trap cannot
 * come back.
 */

/**
 * ⚠️ THE REFERRAL IS CONSTRUCTED, NOT FOUND IN THE SEED, and that is deliberate.
 *
 * No seeded referral holds a queued ward arm AND a queued community arm — I wrote this test against
 * the seed first and it failed with "the seed no longer contains a referral of the shape this test
 * needs", which is the honest failure but not the one under test. Ward Verifier's falsifier F1 asked
 * for exactly this: a property demonstrated on a constructed case, never on pinned fixture ids, so the
 * test cannot quietly start passing because a fixture moved.
