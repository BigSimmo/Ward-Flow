/**
 * Regression fixture pointed at a REAL git repository this test builds and tears down —
 * never the live checkout, and never `origin/main` as it happens to sit on the machine
 * running the test.
 *
 * The previous version of this fixture ran `main()` against `REPOSITORY_ROOT` with
 * `--against origin/main`, i.e. the actual repository and the actual remote ref. That
 * measures something true only at the instant it is captured: merging the integration
 * branch forward changed the worker "invisible" count from 4 to 2 with no change to the
 * script at all — only the ref moved — and it has also been observed as 0 on another
 * checkout. A fixture that asserts a property of a target it does not control is not
 * testing the tool; it is testing whatever the remote happened to look like today.
 *
 * So this block owns BOTH sides of the comparison. `buildWorkerAnalogueFixture()` creates
 * a throwaway git repository (mkdtempSync + real `git init`/`commit`, exactly the pattern
 * tests/adopt-visual-baselines.test.ts and tests/bundle-budget.test.ts already use) with:
 *   - a `worker/` directory of exactly 3 files — entirely owned by this fixture, so unlike
 *     a directory in the live repository this count can never drift out from under the
 *     test (see the module doc's "second trap": hardcoding a LIVE count is the bug this
 *     rewrite exists to remove, not a fix for it).
 *   - a fork commit (HEAD) whose worker/index.ts imports 15 "pipeline stage" files under
 *     src/lib/pipeline — none of them named "worker" — so the closure reaches well beyond
 *     the seed, the way the real `worker` surface does.
 *   - an `upstream` commit, built on top of the fork commit and pointed to by a bare
 *     `refs/remotes/origin/main` ref (no `git remote` registered — git resolves a
 *     remote-tracking ref by name alone), which edits 11 of those 15 stage files plus the
 *     one worker-named file. That is the real, controlled analogue of "origin/main moved
 *     underneath this branch": diffing the fork commit against it names exactly those 12
 *     files, 11 of which no name search for "worker" would ever find.
 *
 * The working tree is left checked out at the fork commit (matching HEAD) because
 * computeClosure() reads the filesystem directly — it has no idea what git thinks HEAD is.

/**
 * ⚠️ **THE COVERAGE THE HERMETIC FIXTURE GAVE UP, RESTORED WITHOUT THE DEFECT THAT SANK IT.**
 *
 * This block replaces four assertions deleted alongside the hermetic rewrite. Those ran the tool
 * over four real surfaces and pinned a SEED COUNT for each — 85, 36, 34, 14. One was already
 * failing (`expected 56 to be 34`), and the test's own `console.warn` told the reader to update
 * the baseline "to match reality". ⚠️ **A test whose documented maintenance procedure is
 * "change the expected value when it changes" is not asserting a property; it is reporting that a
 * folder grew.** Removing them was right. Losing every check against a real repository shape was
 * not.
 *
 * So this asserts only things that CANNOT DRIFT: no counts, no ratios, no thresholds. Add a
 * hundred files to any of these surfaces and nothing here needs editing.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND IT TOUCHES NO GIT REF, NO REMOTE AND NO NETWORK — deliberately, and it is why it calls
 * `computeClosure` rather than `main`.** `main` requires `--against <git-ref>` (it throws
 * "--surface and --against are both required"), so any smoke test built on it would reintroduce
 * exactly the moving-target dependency the rewrite removed. `computeClosure` walks the working
 * tree and nothing else. The ref-handling paths are covered hermetically by the two CATCHER tests
 * above, where the ref's state is owned by the fixture instead of the world.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE FAILURE MODE THIS IS BUILT AGAINST: a smoke test that passes when the tool is dead.**
 * "It ran" is satisfied by a script that finds nothing. So the first assertion is that the surface
 * was actually walked, and it is mutation-proven — a tool returning an empty seed reddens it by
 * name.
