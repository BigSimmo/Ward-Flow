/**
 * ⚠️ A BAR IS THE EASIEST PLACE IN THIS APP TO SAY SOMETHING FALSE, which is why this primitive
 * exists at all and why most of the tests below are about what it REFUSES rather than what it
 * renders. Three screens draw the same stacked bar — the wait-time split on Delays, the locked
 * share on Capacity, the transport lifecycle on Movements — and today none of them shares a line
 * of code with the others.
 *
 * (This sentence read "two of the five tests" until 2026-09-06, when it became four of nine. **A
 * count of its own tests, typed into prose, is stale the moment anyone adds one** — the exact
 * failure this repository has recorded against commit messages, handover documents and guard
 * headers on three separate surfaces. It is now stated without a number.)
 *
 * The lies a stacked bar tells for free — the first two were guarded from the start, the second
 * two were added on 2026-09-06 after Capacity was opened in a browser:
 *
 *   1. **A band with no word.** State is worded as well as coloured everywhere in this app
 *      (`DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md` rule 2, gated in CI). A coloured band carrying meaning on its own is
 *      unreadable to anybody who cannot separate the hues, and there is no way to notice that from
 *      a screenshot.
 *   2. **An all-zero bar.** It renders as an empty grey rail, which a reader takes for a loading
 *      state rather than for "nothing is in any of these categories". The absence has to be
 *      written in words instead, so the component refuses rather than drawing it.
 *
 * Both refusals throw rather than warn: a warning in a browser console is not read by the person
 * this protects.
