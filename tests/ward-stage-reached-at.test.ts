// tests/ward-stage-reached-at.test.ts
//
// Guards the two timestamp defects a reviewer found in `stageReachedAt`
// (ward-management-console.tsx), both of which put a WRONG TIME on the movement workspace's
// current-step sentence rather than a missing one — a false statement, not a gap.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THESE ARE PROPERTIES OVER DRIVEN STATE, NOT DOM ASSERTIONS. The seeded fixture carries
// an empty `stageChanges` on every movement by design, so a rendering test over the seed cannot
// reach either defect: one needs a movement that revisits a stage, the other needs the gap between
// going en route and being collected. Both are produced by driving the real reducer.
//
// ⚠️ `stageReachedAt` IS IMPORTED, NOT RE-IMPLEMENTED. The first version of this file mirrored it,
// because the function was private. That guarded nothing: reverting either fix in the component
// left every assertion here green, since they were exercising the copy — measured by mutation,
// which caught only a source-text pin. The function is now exported and driven directly.
