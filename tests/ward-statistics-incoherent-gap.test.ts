/*
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `emptyBedMinutes` measured `arrivedAt - pulledAt` and clamped the result with
 * `Math.max(0, …)`. That looks like defensive arithmetic and is not.
 *
 * ⚠️ A NEGATIVE GAP MEANS THE RECORD IS INCOHERENT — the patient reached the ward before the bed was
 * allocated to them — NOT that they waited no time at all. Clamping converts "this cannot be true" into
 * "this patient waited zero minutes", which is a perfectly plausible figure nobody would ever query.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. Nine seeded records were measured on 2026-09-01 where the patient
 * arrives BEFORE the referral was raised, by gaps from 1.03 days to 115 days. The clamp would have
 * published all nine as zero-minute waits. The 115-day one is obviously broken and anybody would catch
 * it; the 1.03-day one looks like a timezone bug and would have gone straight through — the dangerous
 * cases are the ones that look almost right.
 *
 * The owner ruled on 2026-09-01 that neither this function nor the statistics screen clamps. An
 * incoherent record must stay visible as incoherent, so it is EXCLUDED from the average rather than
 * folded into it as a zero.
