/**
 * A bare clock face silently asserts TODAY, and this is the list of places allowed to make that
 * claim.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `formatInstant` renders `14:00` whatever day the instant falls on - it wraps with
 * `((instant % 1440) + 1440) % 1440`. The wrap was never the whole defect: the defect is a display
 * making a claim about the day without checking it, so a patient who arrived three days ago reads as
 * this morning. `formatInstantWithDay(instant, now)` says the day out loud whenever it is not today,
 * and history surfaces were moved onto it on 2026-08-30.
 *
 * The sweep changed nothing visible, and that is exactly why this file exists. Every instant in the
 * current fixture falls on the opening day, so `formatInstantWithDay` returns the same bare clock
 * face everywhere and not one test moved. **A sweep no test can see is a sweep that silently
 * un-sweeps**, one helpful edit at a time, and nothing would go red.
 *
 * So the guard is on the CALL SITES rather than on rendered output: every remaining bare
 * `formatInstant` argument is named here with the reason it may assert today. A new one fails until
 * somebody decides which it is.
