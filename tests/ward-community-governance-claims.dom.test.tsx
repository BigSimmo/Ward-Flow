/**
 * 🔴 **THE CLAIMS THE TWO LIVE COMMUNITY SCREENS MAKE, PINNED BEFORE THEIR MARKUP IS TOUCHED.**
 *
 * Ward Lead's ruling on the second-edition adoption: **port prose first, markup second.** This file
 * is the first half. The two screens are about to be redesigned, and a redesign is exactly the kind
 * of change that drops a sentence while every existing test stays green.
 *
 * ⚠️ **MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS WRITTEN, AND THE FIGURE IS WHY IT EXISTS.** Every rendered sentence
 * of eight words or more on both components was extracted and searched for across all 1,224 test
 * files (14.5 million characters): **12 of 44 were pinned by any test. Thirty-two were not** —
 * including "no team has agreed to be represented", which is a governance claim carried by BOTH
 * screens and asserted by neither.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND A TESTID IS NOT A PIN, WHICH IS THE TRAP THAT MAKES THIS LOOK COVERED.** Nine of the
 * thirty testids on these two components are referenced by no test at all, and a reviewer counting
 * `data-testid` attributes would read the pair as thoroughly guarded. Those attributes cost nothing
 * to keep and protect nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS PINS CLAIMS, NOT WORDING, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS DELIBERATE.** Pinning whole sentences
 * would make an honest rewording go red — this project has already been caught with guards that
 * three rephrasings restored to green, and the mirror of that is a guard that forbids improving a
 * sentence. So each entry below is **the shortest clause that cannot still be present if the claim
 * has been dropped**. Reword the sentence around it freely; delete the claim and this goes red.
 *
 * The clauses are grouped by what they protect rather than by which element carries them, because
 * an element can move in a redesign and a claim may not.
