 *     unit-name lookups at module load — a fixture-to-fixture read at data-authoring time, never
 *     a live surface a user's screen renders from.
 *   - `ward-scenarios.ts`'s `scenarioUnits` calls `structuredClone(allUnits())` exactly once —
 *     the single legitimate place ANY live state is ever initialised FROM the frozen fixture, for
 *     either scenario. Ward Flow Phase 4 Task 1 moved this read here from `ward-flow-reducer.ts`:
 *     `seedWardFlowState` no longer touches `allUnits()` itself, it calls `scenarioUnits(scenario)`,
 *     so `ward-flow-reducer.ts` has left this list and `ward-scenarios.ts` has taken its place.
 *     Every later read of unit state anywhere in the app must come from that live `state.units`
 *     (via the provider's `units`), never from `ward-sites.ts` again.

 *     `ward-legal-forms.ts` still matches because its other four entries carry one.
 *   - `ward-flow-reducer.ts` no longer matches, because it no longer authors a form at all — it
 *     attaches one the clinician chose. That is a narrowing of what this predicate has to watch,
 *     not a gap: `tests/ward-legal-figure-guard.test.ts` pins the reducer's authored-code list at
 *     empty, so a reappearing literal there fails that guard.
