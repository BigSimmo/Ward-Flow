/**
 * ⚠️ A FIXED, NON-ZERO ANCHOR OFFSET — the condition under which this defect exists and the one

 *
 * `wallClockNow()` returns minutes-into-the-day (0-1439), so 0 is a real reading — midnight — and
 * gives an offset of 0 - 642 = -642 minutes against the fixture's anchor. Mocked rather than taken
 * from the real clock so the assertions are deterministic; `importActual` keeps every other clock
 * export intact, because the component and the provider both use several.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE VALUE IS CHOSEN, NOT ARBITRARY, AND THE FIRST ONE I PICKED PROVED NOTHING.** The offset
 * only changes a WHOLE-DAY figure for an admission near a day boundary, and every seeded arrival
 * sits 90 minutes into its day. A positive offset cannot reach 1440 from there (the largest
 * available is +797), so at 23:59 the live and frozen readings agree and the test passes against
 * either data source. Midnight's -642 crosses backwards and they diverge. The canary below is what
 * caught that, on the first run, before the assertion could pass for the wrong reason.

/**
 * A LENGTH OF STAY IS COUNTED FROM THE SAME CLOCK THE ARRIVAL WAS RECORDED ON.
 *
 * Ward Board found this shape on `edPressure`: a seed-module parameter default, omitted by every
 * caller, so a RE-ANCHORED `now` was subtracted from an UN-RE-ANCHORED fixture. One side of the
 * subtraction moved. This file is the second instance, which Board's fix did not reach and nobody
 * had reported:
 *
 *     OutOfAreaBoard({ admissions = wardAdmissions })   // the frozen seed
 *     const { units, now } = useWardFlow();             // re-anchored to the hour the demo opens
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THIS SCREEN IS THE WORST PLACE IN THE PROTOTYPE FOR IT, BECAUSE IT RENDERS DAYS IN A
 * BED.** Board's own framing: *a wrong clock looks wrong; a wrong length of stay looks PLAUSIBLE.*
 * A patient shown as eighteen days out of area instead of nine is a believable number on a screen
 * built to be believed, and out-of-area duration is exactly the figure that gets escalated on.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE TRAP IN TESTING IT, WHICH IS WHY THE OLD SUITE WAS EXHAUSTIVE AND STILL BLIND.** Every
 * existing DOM test pins `initialNow`, which makes the anchor offset ZERO — and at zero offset the
 * shifted and unshifted fixtures are identical, so the bug cannot appear. Every unit test passed
 * `admissions` explicitly, which never takes the default. The suite covered the parameter
 * thoroughly and never once covered its ABSENCE at a non-zero offset, the only condition in which
 * the defect exists. **So this file renders `<OutOfAreaBoard />` with NO prop, which is exactly how
 * the route renders it.**
