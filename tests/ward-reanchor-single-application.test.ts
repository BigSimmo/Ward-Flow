/**
 * A CLOCK OFFSET IS APPLIED ONCE, AND THE SECOND APPLICATION IS MADE UNREACHABLE RATHER THAN
 * CHECKED FOR.
 *
 * `shiftInstants` moves every instant in a state by an offset. It carries no already-shifted
 * marker, so applying it twice doubles every offset — and Ward Board's framing is why this outranks
 * its size:
 *
 *   ⚠️ **"A wrong clock looks wrong; a wrong length of stay looks PLAUSIBLE."**
 *
 * A patient nine days in a bed reading as eighteen is not a visibly broken screen. It is a
 * believable number, on a screen whose whole purpose is to be believed, with nothing anywhere to
 * contradict it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **STATED HONESTLY: THIS IS NOT A DEFECT ANY SCREEN SHOWS TODAY.** All three call sites passed
 * a FRESH `seedWardFlowState()`, so nothing was ever double-shifted, and it is a latent hazard
 * rather than a live wrong number. It is worth closing anyway because the cost of closing it is a
 * function signature and the cost of discovering it later is a plausible wrong length of stay.
 *
 * The remedy is `TR-F3`-shaped: make the impossible state unrepresentable instead of checking that
 * the reachable ones look right. `seedWardFlowStateAt` seeds and shifts in one step and CANNOT BE
 * HANDED AN ALREADY-SHIFTED STATE, because it does not take a state at all. `shiftInstants` stays
 * exported for `ward-reanchor.test.ts`, which tests the walker itself — so the last thing needed is
 * a guard that application code never reaches around the safe door to the unsafe one.

   * ⚠️ **COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED, AND THIS GUARD INVENTED A FALSE CALLER BEFORE THEY WERE

   * explained the mechanism accurately — *"`seedWardFlowStateAt`, which is `shiftInstants(seed,
   * offset)`"* — this scan matched the call shape inside that prose and reported the provider as a
   * second application-side caller. **A file that applies no shift at all was named as the exact
   * offence this guard exists to prevent, because it described the problem correctly.**
   *
   * ⚠️ **THE FAILURE DIRECTION IS WHAT MAKES IT WORTH FIXING RATHER THAN WORKING AROUND.** The
   * tempting repair is to reword the comment until the regex is quiet, which leaves the next
   * careful author to hit the same wall and teaches everyone to write vaguer comments. A guard that
   * invents a violation trains people to distrust it and eventually to widen it until the real
   * cases fall out. `tests/ward-mode-workspace-reachability.test.ts` records this happening to it,
   * on the same day, for the same reason.
   *
   * **A MENTION IS NOT A CALL.** Stripping is right HERE specifically because the question is "does
   * this file apply a shift", and code inside a comment applies nothing. It is not a general
   * licence: a guard asking about the source RECORD rather than about what executes must not strip.
   *
   * `stripSourceComments` rather than a local regex — it is literal-aware, and the naive
   * `/\/\*[\s\S]*?\*\//` blanks real code whenever a string contains the two characters that open a
   * comment, which is a silent false NEGATIVE inside a safety guard.
