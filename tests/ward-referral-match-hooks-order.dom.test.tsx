/**
 * `ReferralMatchView` returns early for a referral with no psychiatric-ward destination — an ED or
 * a community team is answered by a person, not by matching a bed — and every one of its hooks was
 * called BELOW that return. React identifies a hook by its call ORDER inside a component, so a
 * component whose hook count depends on a prop has no stable identity for its own state.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO IS THROW, and the reason is worth writing down so nobody re-derives it.
 * React 19.2.8 picks the hook dispatcher with
 * `null !== current && null !== current.memoizedState ? …OnUpdate : …OnMount`
 * (`react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js`), and detects the opposite direction with
 * `didRenderTooFewHooks = null !== currentHook && null !== currentHook.next`. A render that called
 * ZERO hooks leaves `memoizedState` null and never sets `currentHook`, so BOTH guards are asleep
 * for exactly this shape — an early return above every hook. "Rendered more hooks than during the
 * previous render." is never raised here.
 *
 * What happens instead is silent: React takes the MOUNT path again, so this view's local state —
 * the decline-reason draft a coordinator has already chosen, the rejection banner, the
 * prior-rejection ref, and the resize subscription behind `useBandGroupsOpenByDefault` — is
 * discarded and rebuilt, with the old subscription's cleanup never run. That is what the two
 * assertions below pin, because it is what a person would actually see and what actually leaks.
 * They fail while the hooks sit below the return and pass once they sit above it.
