 * EVERY CALL NAMES ITS MOVEMENTS, and that is the change rather than a tidy-up.
 *
 * `edPressure` used to declare `movements: Movement[] = wardMovements`, so a caller who forgot to
 * pass live state silently got the seed fixture and a plausible answer. Both production callers
 * had forgotten — the flow diagram called `edPressure(now)` and the pressure strip was rendered
 * without its optional prop — so raising a referral moved the queue while both ED panels sat still.
 *
 * These tests passed throughout, because they MEANT the fixture. They were the only callers the
 * default was ever right for, which is exactly why it survived: the thing that should have exposed
 * it was the thing it suited. Now they say so.
