/**
 * ⚠️ THE REFER CONTROL, FOR A WARD THAT ONLY DECLINED BEFORE — the half of `4e07bf520` that was
 * wrong, and that its own author's browser check walked straight past.
 *
 * The owner ruled that re-approaching a ward which declined earlier needs NO WRITTEN REASON. The
 * reducer already agreed: `prior_decline` is absent from `SUITABILITY_GATES`, and a probe confirmed
 * `REFER_TO_UNITS` into a previously-declining ward with no `overrideReason` produces 0 rejections
 * and records 0 overrides. THE ENGINE ASKS FOR NOTHING.
 *
 * The screen asked for something. `canRefer` read `verdict.eligible`, which is false for such a
 * ward because the gate genuinely fails, so Refer was inert and said:
 *
 *     "Not eligible — Already declined this movement. Use Override instead."
 *
 * ⚠️ BOTH HALVES FALSE, and the second half is the owner's ruling INVERTED: it instructs a
 * clinician to record a reason the system never wanted, in a patient's file.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY NO EXISTING TEST CAUGHT IT, WHICH IS THE TRANSFERABLE PART. `4e07bf520` fixed the
 * candidates LIST and left the Refer BUTTON reading a different fact — the falsehood was MOVED, not
 * removed. A browser check then passed, because it searched for the sentence that had been deleted
 * and that sentence was genuinely gone. Confirming the old wording is absent is not confirming the
 * screen is right. Found by an adversarial reviewer that measured the rendered control instead.
