/**
 * FD-23, owner 2026-08-30: **a ward cannot see where else a patient has been referred. The
 * coordinator may see everything.** His reason: so a ward does not spend its time on a patient who
 * is being placed elsewhere.
 *
 * This file is the guard the spec (Part 7) demands, and it was written and watched fail BEFORE
 * `ward-referral-visibility.ts` existed. That order is the point: a guard written after the thing
 * it protects is written at the moment its author already believes it works.
 *
 * **Why the rule is encoded as a separate projection rather than a hidden field.** Data that
 * reaches a component can be revealed later by a styling change, a new column or a debug panel.
 * Data a projection never carries cannot be. So the assertions below are about what the projection
 * OBJECT holds, at every level, and never about what a screen chooses to render.
 *
 * **The three properties this file exists to hold, and how each is made non-vacuous:**
 *
 *  1. A ward-scoped projection reaches no other destination's referral data. Checked by a
 *     recursive sweep of every value reachable from the projection root, against markers that a
 *     POSITIVE CONTROL first proves are genuinely present in the full referral. A marker list that
 *     had gone stale would fail the positive control rather than silently pass the sweep.
 *  2. Every level of the projection has its own field-set allowlist. A flat allowlist protects
 *     nothing below the top: this codebase has twice shipped a permitted key holding an unchecked
 *     object, which makes the guard vacuous while it keeps passing and with no diff on the guard
 *     itself. `tests/ward-referral-model.test.ts` already carries three such allowlists (referral,
 *     addressing, arm); these are the same pattern for the projection. The totality assertion —
 *     that the projection contains EXACTLY the three object nodes those allowlists cover and no
 *     fourth anywhere — is what stops a new nested shape arriving unguarded.
 *  3. The fixture really has other destinations to hide. A rule about hiding the others cannot be
 *     tested on a referral that has no others, so the destination count is asserted inside the
 *     sweep helper itself, not only in a standalone test that could be deleted without the leak
 *     tests noticing.
 *
 * The fixture is built through the reducer's own write path (`RECEIVE_REFERRAL` →
 * `DECLINE_REFERRAL` → `ACCEPT_REFERRAL`), never hand-assembled, so the states it holds are states
 * the live system actually produces — including the FD-22 cancellation the third destination
 * receives when the second accepts.

 * A referral addressed to all three destinations at once (FD-21), where the ward has DECLINED and

 *
 * Chosen so the ward's own addressing state (`declined`) differs from the referral's overall state
 * (`queued` — the emergency department has not answered, and a community acceptance never settles
 * that question; see `referralState`'s own doc comment). A projection that leaked the derived
 * overall state would therefore be telling the ward something about a decision it took no part in,
 * which is exactly the thing FD-23 forbids, and a fixture where the two states coincided could not
 * tell the difference.
 *
 * 🔴 **BEFORE RB5 (item 16), a community acceptance here cancelled the still-queued ED arm and the
 * referral's overall state read `"accepted"`.** Both were the defect RB5 closes: a community
 * acceptance is follow-up, not a bed decision, so it cancels nothing and never settles a bed
 * question a ward or ED destination is still open to answer.

   * ⚠️ **THE COMMUNITY TEAM ACCEPTS, NOT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT — CHANGED 2026-09-01, AND IT IS
   * LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN COSMETIC.**
   *
   * At the time this fixture was reshaped, it needed to contain a destination in state `cancelled`,
   * because the positive control below asserted every `ELSEWHERE_MARKERS` marker was present in the
   * full referral — without one, the absence sweep could not fail and proved nothing.
   *
   * It used to be the community arm that cancelled when the ED accepted. The owner then ruled that a
   * community team is never cancelled by somebody else's acceptance (*"Community referral means a
   * patient is about to be discharged"*), so nothing cancelled any more and **the positive control
   * fired — correctly, refusing to let the sweep pass vacuously.**
   *
   * Swapping which destination answers restored a real cancellation while keeping all three
   * destination KINDS and their exact field shapes. **Two alternatives were tried and rejected:** a
   * fourth destination is refused by `PARALLEL_REFERRAL_CAP` (3), and replacing the community arm with
   * a second emergency department broke the field-set allowlists, because an ED arm carries `edId` and
   * `purpose` where a community arm carries `teamName`.
   *
   * ⚠️ **THAT WAS THE FIX FOR ONE CANCELLATION ROUTE. IT DID NOT SURVIVE THE NEXT RULING, AND
   * `"cancelled"` HAS SINCE MOVED OFF THIS FIXTURE ENTIRELY — WHICH IS A SEPARATE MOVE, NOT A REVERSAL
   * OF THIS ONE.** Owner ruling 2 (2026-09-01) — an acceptance of a `leaving` destination cancels
   * nothing — removes this fixture's COORDINATOR-ACCEPTS-COMMUNITY route to `cancelled` too, the
   * moment Ward Lead's reducer change lands. Reshaping this fixture a third time to chase that would
   * repeat the same trap this comment already warns against. Instead `"cancelled"` was split into its
   * own marker set, `CANCELLED_ELSEWHERE_MARKERS`, over its own small fixture (`cancelledArmReferral()`,
   * defined below `ELSEWHERE_MARKERS`) built on a route that survives the change: a WARD accepting is
   * `arriving`, which the ruling never exempts. **This fixture no longer needs to reach `cancelled` at
   * all** — it still does today, incidentally, but nothing here depends on that any more. Deleting
   * `"cancelled"` outright, with nothing replacing it, would still be weakening the privacy sweep;
   * relocating it to a fixture that does not go stale is not that.
   *
   * The scenario THIS fixture exists for is unchanged in substance: the ward said no, and somebody
   * else has since said yes. 🔴 **RB5 (item 16, 2026-09-17) is the moment this comment's own
   * prediction landed: `"cancelled"` is gone from this fixture.** A community acceptance now
   * cancels nothing (owner ruling, "a community referral does not compete with a bed"), so the
   * third ask — the ED — stays `"queued"`, genuinely still open, rather than ending as a
   * consequence of an acceptance it was never competing with.

 *
 * **The destination COUNT is not on this list, and the positive control below is what established
 * that it must not be.** `3` was on it in the first draft. The control failed: the count is derived
 * (`destinations.length`), never a value stored anywhere in the referral, so "it is present in the

 * accepting the `community_team` arm, which today cancels the queued ED arm and after the change
 * cancels nothing at all. Leaving `"cancelled"` on this list would make the positive control below
 * go red the day that change lands, on a fixture that can no longer prove the marker. One marker set
 * was doing two jobs — proving the ward-declined privacy case here AND proving the cancelled state is

 * 2026-09-04.** The header of `ward-referral-visibility.ts` said the coordinator field set was
 * enforced by `tsc` rather than by this suite, and that is true only for a field REMOVED. Adding
 * `...referral` to the root of `coordinatorScopedReferral` — so the projection silently gained
 * `patientId`, `suburb` and `triagedAt` — left **all 116 tests in this file passing and
 * `npx tsc -p tsconfig.typecheck.json --noEmit` at exit 0**. TypeScript's excess-property check does
 * not reach properties arriving through a spread, so an object literal assigned to a declared type
 * accepts extra ones in this position. **The claim was load-bearing: a reviewer reads it and stops
 * looking**, which is what happened until somebody ran the mutation. The module header is corrected
 * to say exactly what `tsc` does and does not catch; this list is what actually holds the addition
 * half.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS IS NOT THE SAME VERDICT THE `suburb` GUARD AT THE FOOT OF THIS FILE DECLINES TO BUY.**
 * That block reasons that a field's absence is not a decision and refuses to forbid the coordinator
 * one NAMED field nobody has ruled on. This says nothing about any named field: it requires the
 * object and its own declaration to agree. A ruling that widens the declaration satisfies it
 * automatically. The two are compatible, and neither may be deleted as a copy of the other.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`destinations` IS ON THIS LIST AND ITS CONTENTS ARE DELIBERATELY UNGUARDED.** The coordinator
 * seat differs from the other two by design — `destinations: referral.destinations` hands the arms
 * over whole because a coordinator sees everything. This guard is about the ROOT and about the other

   * answered *"Yes can see."* (`docs/ward-flow/owner-rulings-2026-09-04.md`.)
   *
   * **So this block is the only one in this file whose job is partly to prove a DISCLOSURE happens.**
   * The ward and community blocks above assert absence; here the destination list must be PRESENT,
   * because a projection that quietly failed to carry it would be re-imposing a restriction the owner
   * lifted, and every absence-shaped guard in this file would stay green while it did.
   *
   * ⚠️ **AND THE LIMIT IS THE HALF THAT NEEDS GUARDING, BECAUSE IT IS THE HALF NOBODY WILL
   * REMEMBER.** "May see the destinations" is not "may see everything": the ruling itself says so, in
   * terms. `EdScopedDestinationSummary` carries a kind and a state; the coordinator seat hands
   * `ReferralAddressing[]` over whole with its contents deliberately unguarded, and the distance
   * between those two is exactly `ALLOWED_ED_DESTINATION_SUMMARY_FIELDS`. Widen that list to the arms
   * and the ED seat becomes the coordinator seat under another name, with the root allowlist still
   * green.
   *
   * **Every assertion below derives its keys by calling the real projection.** The two hand-built
   * inputs exist because no reducer path produces the shapes they hold; the assertions are still over
   * what the projection returned, never over a shape this test wrote.

/**
 * THE COORDINATOR'S WORK LIST — a different question from FD-23, answered beside it.
 *
 * **Owner ruling, 2026-09-01, verbatim: "Any referrals to community Do NOT need to be flagged in
 * the coordinators screen."** His reason: a community referral is *discharge planning* — the
 * patient is leaving. It is not a rival bed offer and it is not part of bed-matching.
 *
 * **The criterion is DIRECTION, and the seed holds the case that proves it is not something
 * simpler.** A referral is the coordinator's work while a live destination is still UPSTREAM of the
 * bed decision, and stops being it once the live ones are all downstream. `RF-009` asks for no ward
 * bed at all — one emergency-department destination, purpose `psychiatric_review` — and the owner
 * ruled it STAYS VISIBLE. So the rule cannot be "the referral asks for no bed": that criterion
 * removes RF-009 too, and it is wrong.
 *
 * **The rule reads the LIVE arms, not merely the kinds.** A referral whose ward arm is DECLINED and
 * whose community arm is still QUEUED has no bed question left to answer — every ward that could
 * have taken the patient has said no, and the only live arm is the community follow-up. A kind-only
 * rule keeps that row in the bed-matching queue, presented as somebody awaiting a bed. It is
 * exactly the class the ruling exists to remove, and the seed contains no example of it, so the
 * fixtures below are built.
 *
 * **Why this is a second function and not a filter inside `coordinatorScopedReferrals`.** FD-23
 * (2026-08-30) answers *which FIELDS a viewer may see of a referral*, and its answer for the
 * coordinator is "everything". This ruling answers *which REFERRALS belong in the coordinator's
 * work list*. Filtering the FD-23 projection would silently invert a standing ruling, so the
 * regression guard at the bottom of this block holds `coordinatorScopedReferrals` to returning
 * every referral, community-only ones included.

 * lines up in `ward-referral-visibility.ts`, which forbids duplicating the projection's shape:
 *
 *   - **Re-asserting the eleven-field list would be buying the same verdict twice.** `tsc` already
 *     holds that contract, and a copied list decays independently of the type it copies.
 *   - **This is the opposite case.** A type states what IS present; no type can state what must
 *     NEVER be. `tsc` cannot fail on a field nobody wrote, so **no gate holds this rule at all** —
 *     there is no second verdict, only a first one.
 *
 * The positive control matters more than usual here. An absence check over a fixture that never had
 * the field would pass forever while proving nothing, so this asserts the source referral DOES carry
 * `suburb` before asserting the projection does not. **Otherwise the day `suburb` is renamed on
