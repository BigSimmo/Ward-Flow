// THE FRONT-DOOR LINK: `Movement.referralId`, its one writer (`RAISE_REFERRAL`) and its one
// reader (`referralForMovement`).
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE DISPATCHES EVENTS INSTEAD OF BUILDING OBJECTS, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT.
//
// `Admission.referralId` is documented as "the join back to the front door" and joins to nothing:
// every seeded value is manufactured from the admission's own id by string substitution and the
// one runtime writer honestly writes `null`. It compiles, it renders, it means nothing, and no
// typecheck and no test can see that — see `docs/ward-flow/fields-with-no-producer-2026-09-01.md`,
// where it is finding zero and the reason all 65 community team pages are empty.
//
// A test that hand-builds a `Movement` with `referralId` set and then looks it up would pass
// against exactly that defect. So every test below walks the real flow, owner ruling 8's flow:
// a community team raises a referral addressed to an emergency department, and that department
// then raises the journey. The only objects here are the ones the reducer made.
