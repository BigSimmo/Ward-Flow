/**
 * 🔴 **RE-POINTED AT `DelaysScreen` ON 2026-09-05, AND THE OBVIOUS CALL — "retire it, the bug it
 * guards cannot exist here" — WAS THE WRONG ONE.**
 *
 * This file rendered `<WardModeWorkspace mode="queue" />`. MERGE 01 folded the priority queue, the
 * exceptions inbox and the escalation board into `DelaysScreen` and made
 * `/mockups/ward-flow/queue` a redirect, so the pin went on passing over a screen no coordinator
 * can open.
 *
 * **The property is not about a selection control. It is about STALENESS.** `QueueView` held the
 * selected movement as `useState(movements[0])` — the record object itself, captured once at
 * mount — so a dispatch that later changed that record was never reflected: the panel rendered
 * pre-dispatch fields forever. The fix held the id and derived the record from live state.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`DelaysScreen` HAS NO LOCAL STATE AT ALL, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY RETIRING THIS LOOKED
 * CORRECT — AND WHY IT WOULD HAVE LEFT A HOLE.** Nothing is captured, so that particular bug shape
 * is unreachable *today*. But the property a reader actually depends on is the observable one: **a
 * change dispatched after this screen mounts must appear on it.** Measured 2026-09-05, before
 * deciding: `ward-delays-screen.dom.test.tsx` contains 14 cases and **not one `fireEvent` or
 * `dispatch` among them** — every case is a single static render — and a repository-wide search for
 * tests naming `DelaysScreen` found no dispatch against it anywhere. **Nothing whatever proved this
 * screen reacts to state changing underneath it.** Retiring the file would have removed the only
 * test in the repository asking that question of any merged screen.
 *
 * So the subject moved and the question did not. `WF-004` sits at stage `pulled`; `RELEASE_PULL`
 * moves it to `accepted_awaiting_bed`, and `DelayRow` renders `stageCopy[movement.stage].label` on
 * the row. A screen holding a record captured at mount would keep showing the old label — the same
 * failure the decision panel's badge showed on the screen this replaces.
 *
 * Both labels are read from `stageCopy`, never written in, and the case asserts they differ before
 * comparing anything — floored rather than escaped, because two equal labels would let a genuinely
 * stale screen pass.
 */

/** Raises a real `RELEASE_PULL` from a sibling of the screen, so the dispatch travels through the

 * only an id, a wait and a cause title) beside a detail panel that renders the SAME `DelayRow` this
 * file always asserted against — but only for whichever one patient is selected.
 * `rowFor`'s old `getByText(id, {selector: "[data-ward-primitive='record-id']"})`
