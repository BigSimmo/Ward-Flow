/**
 * `.claude/settings.json` is the only place where AGENTS.md's provider-confirmation
 * boundary is enforced rather than merely stated. Prose did not hold for the PR-following
 * rule — `.claude/hooks/pr-handoff-stop.sh` says so in its own header, "prose rules in
 * AGENTS.md have not held, a denied tool call does" — and there is no reason to expect it to
 * hold better for provider access.
 *
 * These tests pin the two properties that make the block trustworthy. Both were asserted in
 * review before they were ever measured, which is the failure shape this session kept hitting:
 * a check that cannot fail is not a check.
 *
 * 1. **No `allow` rule may reach a provider-backed script.** The block deliberately avoids
 *    broad wildcards such as `Bash(npm run check:*)` precisely so the outcome never depends on
 *    allow-versus-ask precedence. If someone later broadens the allow list for convenience,
 *    this goes red.
 * 2. **Every provider-backed script must carry an `ask` rule.** `ask` is also the default for
 *    an unlisted command, so these rules buy no protection on their own — what they buy is a
 *    machine-readable statement of the boundary that survives a future broadening, and a list
 *    that fails loudly when a new provider script is added without one.
 *
 * Plus one hook property: every hook command invokes its script through an interpreter rather
 * than by bare path. `session-start.sh` was registered by bare path AND checked in as mode
 * 100644, so on the Linux web containers that are the only place it does any work, it could
 * not run. See the "Claude Code hook scripts" section in AGENTS.md.

/**
 * Loosening `Bash(git push:*)`, `Bash(git add:*)`, and `Bash(gh pr create:*)` for routine
 * work (PR #2243) opened three gaps review caught, all on this same permissions file:
 *
 * 1. The generic push allow rule also matches a `HEAD:main` (or `<branch>:main`) destination
 *    refspec, not just a literal `main`/`master` source ref — the existing deny rules only
 *    covered the latter shape.
 * 2. The generic `git add` allow rule also matches `git add -f`/`--force`, which force-stages
 *    an otherwise-.gitignore'd file (e.g. `.env.local`) with no confirmation.
 * 3. `gh pr create` was blanket-allowed, letting an agent open a PR and trigger hosted CI
 *    without the confirmation provider-backed GitHub writes otherwise require.
 *
 * The 2026-09-02 audit (M21) then showed that closing `HEAD:main` was not enough: permission
 * rules are prefix matches, so the blanket `Bash(git push:*)` allow let every other spelling
 * through with no prompt — `origin --force <b>`, `origin +<b>` (refspec force), `-u origin main`,
 * `--delete`, `--mirror`, and `--no-verify` (which also skips `guard-push.mjs`). The fix is
 * two-sided: the allow list names only the safe spellings (plain `git push`, `git push origin
 * HEAD`, and `git push -u origin claude/<branch>`), so every other spelling falls back to the
 * default ask; and the deny list spells out the force, delete, mirror, hook-skipping, and
 * main/master-target shapes so those hard-stop rather than prompt.
 *
 * These tests pin the fixes using the same `bashRuleMatches` prefix-match model above.
