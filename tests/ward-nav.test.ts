 * `next/navigation`'s `useRouter` synchronously during render — and, since this file also renders
 * `AddPatientForm` and `ReferralIntakeForm`, `useSearchParams` for the same reason. This is the

     * disagreement feels like it has been read. **"Take the larger" and "take the newer" both give 39,
     * and 39 is wrong.** Neither reflex counts anything. Contributed by the lane that resolved the
     * same merge independently an hour later and arrived at 40 by the only method that works.
     *
     * ⚠️ **AND THE POPULATION IS WRITTEN HERE BECAUSE THE WALK COMMAND DOES NOT SAY WHAT IT COUNTS.**
     * It counts the ward-flow SUBTREE. 🔴 **`/mockups/ward-flow-sign-in` is a SIBLING directory, not a
     * child, so it is OUTSIDE this figure** — measured, not assumed: the walk returns zero paths
     * containing `sign-in`, and that directory holds one more `page.tsx` of its own. **40 is right for
     * "routes under the ward-flow subtree" and wrong for "ward screens".**
     *
     * Both sides' reasoning is kept, because both routes exist and both reasons are still true:
     *
     * • `/alerts` — a `page.tsx` rendering a screen, registered in `WARD_NAV` with an icon, and
     *   covered by `tests/ward-alerts-screen.dom.test.tsx`. A route added without all three fails one
     *   of the three gates below rather than this count, which is why this number moving ALONE is the
     *   thing to distrust.
     * • `/settings` — a genuine new build. ⚠️ **It is deliberately NOT in `WARD_NAV`**, by the
     *   drawing's own instruction ("Settings has no rail item of its own … it opens from Tools on every
     *   screen"), so it is registered in `WARD_NAV_INTENTIONALLY_UNLISTED` with a reason saying plainly
     *   that the Tools link is another lane's file and is not built yet.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * The DYNAMIC half of the D8 check.
 *
 * `staticRoutes` above is filtered to static routes, so until now a dynamic route was checked for
 * pattern SHAPE only — never for whether anything links it. The one orphan this programme found,
 * the board's ward-detail route, was dynamic, which is exactly why nothing caught it.
 *
 * **What these assertions prove, stated precisely, because the obvious version of this guard is
 * wrong.** A source scan can see that a route is REFERENCED. It cannot see that every instance
 * the route serves is REACHABLE, and the difference is not academic: a link built inside a
 * `.map()` may iterate the whole collection or a context-derived subset of three, and the two are
 * textually identical. `ward-role-switcher.tsx` builds `/mockups/ward-flow/ward/${unit.id}` over
 * `wardCandidates`, which is EMPTY unless a movement is focused and is otherwise that movement's
 * accepted unit or its referred units — nought to three. So `ward/[unitId]` HAS a link builder
 * while twenty-two of its twenty-three wards have no route in at all. A guard reading that
 * builder as reachability would certify those twenty-two as fine, which is the same defect class
 * as the orphan it was written to catch. Nothing below claims reachability.
 *
 * The property that IS mechanical: how many of a route's instances are named by a CONCRETE href
 * somewhere in `src/` — an href a reader can follow with nothing selected and no state at all.
 * That number is computed by the scan, the number of instances is read from the live fixture, and
 * any shortfall must be recorded in `WARD_DYNAMIC_ROUTE_ORPHANS` with BOTH numbers written out in
 * full. A reason can be vague and still satisfy a check; a coverage figure cannot, because the
 * scan recomputes both halves of it and compares them to the words. Seed a twenty-fourth unit and
 * every entry that says "of 23" goes red until somebody re-counts.

   * The unescaped prefix, used to ask whether a matched segment is really a SIBLING STATIC ROUTE
   * rather than an instance of this dynamic one.
   *
   * ⚠️ ADDED 2026-09-02, and a real route exposed it. `/mockups/ward-flow/people/new` is a static
   * page — the screen for adding a person who is not in the system yet — but to a source scan the
   * segment `new` is indistinguishable from a patient id, so the href counted as one patient
   * "reachable without state". Nobody is reachable through it: it serves no instance at all.
   *
   * The fix is here rather than in the recorded figure deliberately. Updating the entry to say
   * "1 of 8" would have made the guard green while recording something FALSE — that a patient can
   * be reached without state, when what exists is a sibling route being miscounted. **A number
   * changed to match a miscount ratifies the miscount.**
   *
   * ⚠️ OBSERVED, NOT ASSUMED, and the distinction is the reason this paragraph is long. The skip
   * rests on a static segment resolving ahead of a dynamic sibling — and that rule is NOT stated
   * anywhere in this repo's own Next 16.3.0 docs for the App Router. The only precedence sentence
   * in the whole local docs tree is about PAGES-router API routes
   * (`02-pages/.../07-api-routes.md:413`); `dynamic-routes.md` defines a static segment as "a
   * literal value matched exactly" and never says what happens when both siblings match. Control:
   * 93 files under `01-app` mention "segment", so the search reaches the App Router docs and the
   * absence is real. This repository's standing rule is that Next 16 differs from training data,
   * so "I know how Next works" is exactly the reasoning it forbids.
   *
   * So it was MEASURED instead: on 2026-09-02, `/mockups/ward-flow/people/new` was loaded in a
   * browser against the running dev server and rendered the ADD-A-PATIENT FORM — page title
   * "Add a patient — Ward Flow" — not a patient page with `new` read as an id. The static route
   * wins here, so a concatenated path that is a real static route on disk genuinely cannot reach
   * the dynamic route, and the skip is exact rather than heuristic.
   *
   * ⚠️ RE-RUN THAT PAGE LOAD IF THIS EVER LOOKS WRONG, and do not accept this guard being green as
   * evidence: it is green BECAUSE the skip is in place, so if the assumption were false the guard
   * would be green precisely because it had stopped looking. A passing test and the truth point in
   * opposite directions here, and only the browser separates them.

 * had been written a shade more loosely would have counted the rail's example as the index's
 * twenty-third ward and reported full coverage while the page missed one. So:

 *
 * The testid is per-ward (`ward-index-link-${unit.id}`, fixed 2026-09 — 23 wards previously shared
 * the one literal `"ward-index-link"`, which made `getByTestId('ward-index-link')` ambiguous). The
 * `\1` backreference requires the testid's own id to match the href's, so this scan also catches a
 * ward whose link testid and href silently disagree — a bug the old literal-string match could not

 * silently stopped matching anchors reads as a mismatch rather than as a shorter list.
