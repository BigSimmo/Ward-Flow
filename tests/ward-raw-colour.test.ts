/**
 * 🔴 **THE WARD STYLESHEETS HAVE NO COLOUR DETECTOR, AND THAT IS WHY THIS EXISTS.**
 * `eslint-rules/no-hardcoded-hex.mjs` matches Tailwind class names in `.ts`/`.tsx` only, so a raw
 * `#1b2533` in a ward CSS module is reported by nothing at all. The `--ward-*` layer in
 * `ward-tokens.module.css` bridges onto the repository design system (`--ward-ground: var(--surface)`,
 * `--ward-border: var(--neutral-500)`, and so on), and a stylesheet that paints its own colour
 * silently leaves that bridge — which is how a set of screens drifts apart while every gate is green.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE ESTATE IS CLEAN TODAY, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF INSTALLING THIS NOW.** Measured
 * 2026-09-06 across all 51 ward stylesheets: **zero** raw colour in declarations. Every hex and
 * every `rgb()` in the tree is inside a COMMENT, recording a measured contrast ratio or a computed
 * value from the print and forced-colours work. So this guard protects a clean surface rather than
 * cleaning a dirty one, and its floor is on the POPULATION WALKED for exactly that reason — see
 * the anti-vacuity test below.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ **DO NOT "FIX" A FAILURE HERE BY EDITING A COMMENT.** The hex values in these files are
 * evidence. `ward-table.module.css` records `--surface-subtle (#fbfcfd) vs --text-muted (#55627a):
 * 5.99:1`; deleting those numbers destroys the proof that the table meets contrast and leaves a
 * claim nobody can re-check. This guard never reads comments, so it can never ask you to.
 *
 * ## What this guard SEES, and what it does NOT
 *
 * It reads CSS **text**, with comments stripped. That is the artefact you search, not the artefact
 * that runs, and the difference has produced clean wrong answers in this repository before. So,
 * explicitly:
 *
 * - **SEES** a literal hex, `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()` or `hsla()` written in a declaration in any
 *   ward stylesheet, including one added tomorrow — the population is discovered from disk.
 * - **DOES NOT SEE** a colour reaching a ward screen through an inline `style={{...}}` in TSX, a
 *   `composes:` target in another stylesheet, a colour injected at build time, or a token whose own
 *   definition elsewhere is a raw value. **A pass here is not a statement that ward screens use only
 *   design-system colour** — it is the narrower claim that no ward stylesheet declares one itself.
 * - **DOES NOT SEE** whether the token chosen is the RIGHT one. `var(--ward-border)` where
 *   `var(--ward-border-strong)` was meant passes here and always will. Consistency of choice is a
 *   design question and this is a mechanical guard.
 *
 * Being a `readFileSync` scanner, it is also invisible to `npm run test:focused` — vitest selects by
 * import graph and this file imports no source. It runs in the full suite.

/**
 * CSS has only block comments. Strip them PRESERVING NEWLINES, so reported line numbers stay true
 * and a colour mentioned in prose cannot be mistaken for a declaration.
 *
 * This is the whole correctness of the guard. Ward Lead's first survey of this estate reported 24
 * offending files; comment-stripped it is 0, and the 24 were measurement records.
 *
 * A second detector additionally matched `#2384` in `ward-management-modes.module.css` — a
 * pull-request number, which is a legal `#RGBA`. ⚠️ **That was not an independent confirmation and
 * should not be read as one: it was found by the author of that detector, reported against their
 * own count** (Ward Builder One, 2026-09-06). One person auditing their own number is a different
 * claim from two converging, and the weaker-sounding one is the harder direction to check in.
 *
 * Either way the lesson holds: the stripping is doing work no amount of pattern refinement can do.
