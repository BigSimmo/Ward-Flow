/**
 * `edPressure` clamps `longestWaitMinutes` to 0 for a department with nobody waiting — a
 * correct internal value, but "0 waiting · longest 0m" is a plausible-looking duration for a
 * department where no duration exists to measure (Task 4 review Important 5). No fixture
 * department is currently quiet, so this was latent: nothing would have caught it reaching a
 * screen. `movements={[]}` makes every one of the 10 departments quiet without waiting for the
 * live fixture to grow one, by handing `PressureStrip` the state it is to read (mirrors
 * `edPressure`'s own `(now, movements)` parameter).
 *
 * `movements` USED TO BE OPTIONAL HERE, described in this file as a test-only injection point.
 * It was not test-only: the coordinator screen rendered this strip without it, so the strip read
 * the frozen seed while the referral queue beside it read live state. The description was true of
 * the intent and false of the code, and nothing could tell the difference because omitting the
 * argument produced a plausible answer instead of an error.

     * and every `arrivedAt` move together by the same offset and the figures come out identical.
     * The old code moved only ONE of them: `now` was the re-anchored clock and the movements were
     * the untouched seed, so every wait was inflated by exactly the offset — wrong from the first
     * paint, not only after somebody raised a referral.
     *
     * So the property is invariance: shift both by the same amount and the longest wait must not
     * move. Handing the strip the seed at a shifted `now` — the old behaviour — breaks it, which is
     * the second half of this test and the reason the first half is not vacuous.
