/**
 * Task 10: the live tracker's own rendering decisions — never a re-test of `transportLeg`'s
 * precedence chain, which already has full coverage in `tests/ward-derivations.test.ts`. This
 * file exists specifically to close the gap the task-10 preflight's LATE ADDITION section flags:
 * the seed fixture only ever exercises two of the five legs ("Accepted", "Collected") end to end,
 * so a Playwright assertion against real seed data can never prove the other three legs, or
 * "Cancelled", or the no-transport absence, render correctly. Every case below constructs its own
 * `TransportJob` rather than relying on the fixture, for exactly that reason.
