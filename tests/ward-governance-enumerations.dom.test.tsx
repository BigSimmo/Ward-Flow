/**
 * GOVERNANCE PARAGRAPHS THAT ENUMERATE WHAT A SCREEN DOES MUST NAME EVERYTHING IT DOES.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CLASS. Three screens told a clinician what they record or show, the code later gained a
 * category, and the sentence was never touched:
 *
 *   patient-search    named people and open movements; also renders QUEUED REFERRALS, first
 *   referral-intake   named five facts and the request; the payload also writes `patientId`
 *   officer-screen    said "every transport job not yet arrived"; the filter also drops CLOSED ones
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE DIRECTION IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE USUAL FAILURE HERE. The defect this project keeps
 * finding is a change propagated into the comments that stops before the rendered page. These are
 * changes that reached the CODE and never touched the sentence at all. Same missing step, other
 * way round — which is why neither a comment audit nor a code audit alone would have found them.
 *
 * ⚠️ EACH REPAIR GETS TWO INDEPENDENT ASSERTIONS: one that the BEHAVIOUR is what we think, and one
 * that the SENTENCE says so. A wording pin alone is worthless — it goes green the moment somebody
 * rephrases and red the moment somebody improves. Paired with a driven behaviour assertion, a
 * mutation to either half turns exactly one of them red, and the pair tells you which half moved.

     * The three textareas were themselves collapsed to ONE optional `history` field by the same

     * free text into the model, one field's worth instead of three, so the assertions below (which
     * check the DISTINCTION rather than a box count) still hold.
     *
     * 🔴 AND IT DID NOT CATCH THE LIE. The banner still said "never free text" for the whole build,
     * with this test green throughout, because "contains the denial" is satisfied just as well by
     * a denial that has become false. The paragraph was fixed after somebody opened the page.
