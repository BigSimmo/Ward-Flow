   * redeclaration of the canonical block". Ward Verifier checked that claim per module, deriving
   * the signature of a redeclaration from an ACCEPTED migration rather than from the claim:
   *
   *   ward-management-modes    STRUCTURAL. `.dataTable th` is `position: sticky`, and a sticky
   *                            header REQUIRES `border-collapse: separate` — collapsed borders do
   *                            not travel with it. The primitive collapses, so migrating this would
   *                            silently lose the sticky header on a six-route component.
   *                            `.candidateTable` is `display: grid`, not a table at all.
   *   ward-management-network  STRUCTURAL for `.compareTable` — borders on all four sides,
   *                            `--text-3xs`, `td[data-tone]` semantics: a matrix, not a
   *                            row-separated list. (Its `.tableScroll` IS a plain duplicate of the
   *                            primitive's wrapper and is queued separately.)
   *   ed                       NOT STRUCTURAL — DEFERRED, NOT CLEARED. Its `.capacityTable th/td`
   *                            carries the canonical padding byte-identically and the same border
   *                            idiom. Every difference is a value or an addition. Whether the
   *                            primitive should grow to absorb it is a design decision nobody has
   *                            taken.
   *
   * WHY THE LIST IS NOT EMPTY, WHICH IS THE POINT. It was emptied when the last migration landed,
   * and an empty list made this assertion read "the estate is clean". The estate was not clean —
   * it simply did not use the class name the detector looked for. Two different claims, and only
   * the first was ever proved.
   *
   * Removing an entry without migrating its file makes the assertion false again. Removing one
   * BECAUSE the file was migrated is what the entry is for.
