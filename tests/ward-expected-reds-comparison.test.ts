/**
 * THE CONTROL FOR THE EXPECTED-RED GATE, AND IT EXISTS BECAUSE ONE OF ITS TWO DIRECTIONS NEVER
 * FIRES IN NORMAL USE.
 *
 * "An unexpected red fails the gate" is easy to believe, easy to check, and fires the first time
 * anybody breaks anything. **"An entry that STOPS failing also fails the gate" fires only on a day
 * when everything looks like it is going right** — which is precisely the day it is needed, and
 * precisely why it cannot be left to a habit or a hand-run.
 *
 * 🔴 **IT IS THE PROPERTY THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE INCIDENT THIS GATE WAS COMMISSIONED FOR.** On
 * 2026-09-06 a deliberate red was retired under CI pressure, using a builder's open position quoted
 * as though it were the owner's ruling. **The suite went green and thanked whoever did it.** Nothing
 * in the repository objected, because nothing was watching that direction.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND IT IS THE PROPERTY AN `it.fails` TRIPWIRE STRUCTURALLY CANNOT GIVE**, which is the whole
 * argument for a pinned list over a converted test: `it.fails` passes on ANY error including a typo
 * in the test body, and keeps passing after the defect is fixed. It converts a visible red into an
 * invisible green — the opposite of what is wanted.
 *
 * The gate's own comparison is imported rather than re-implemented here. A control that re-writes
 * the logic it is checking proves only that two copies agree.
