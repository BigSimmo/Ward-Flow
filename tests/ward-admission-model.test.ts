/**
 * STRUCTURAL PRIVACY, following the Phase 4/5/7 pattern (`tests/ward-referral-model.test.ts`'s
 * `Referral` allowlist, `tests/ward-bed-availability-model.test.ts`'s `LeaveBed` allowlist): an
 * ALLOWLIST of the exact field set, so a future field named `notes`, `diagnosis`, `name` or `dob`
 * FAILS rather than being discouraged by convention.
 *
 * Two halves, because one of them alone would be blind:
 *
 *   - The `ADMISSION_FIELDS` half is checked by plain `vitest run`, no `tsc` involved. That array
 *     is derived in the source from a total `Record<keyof Admission, true>`, so the compiler
 *     refuses a field added to the type and left out of it — and once it is in, this test fails
 *     at runtime. This is the half that catches a new field while an implementer is working.
 *   - The canonical-literal half is checked by TypeScript, not by vitest: every `Admission` field
 *     is required, so a field added to the type and omitted from the literal is a COMPILE error,
 *     invisible to `vitest run`. It is kept because it pins the two halves to each other.
 *
 * Stated plainly, because a guard that overstates its reach is this repository's most repeated
 * failure: a field added to `Admission` AND to neither the record nor the literal is caught by
 * `tsc` alone, not by this file.
 *
 * **THE LIST BELOW WAS WIDENED ON PURPOSE ON 2026-08-29, from fifteen fields to seventeen.**
 * `dischargeConfirmedAt` and `dischargeConfirmedBy` were added by an owner ruling, and the
 * widening is recorded here rather than absorbed silently — the same discipline `Referral` held to
 * when it went from three fields to five. An allowlist that grows without anybody saying so is not
 * an allowlist.
 *
 * What makes that widening permissible is WHAT the two fields are about. A discharge date is a
 * PLAN; confirming it is the ward's own DECISION, and both new fields record the ward's act — when
 * it decided, and which ROLE decided — in exactly the category `dischargeDateSetAt` and
 * `dischargeDateSetBy` already occupy. Neither is a fact about the person in the bed.
 *
 * **AND WIDENED AGAIN, LATER THE SAME DAY, TO EIGHTEEN — `tentativeDiagnosis`.** This one IS a
 * fact about the person, and it is the first. The owner reversed the standing no-diagnosis rule
 * himself: "It can give a tentative diagnosis. This is because most referrals will require a
 * diagnosis", and "Just create broad core categories used in Australia for mental health coding
 * for now". What ships is a single value from `TENTATIVE_DIAGNOSIS_BLOCKS` — eleven ICD-10-AM
 * Chapter V block headings — or `null`. Nothing finer, and no free-text route to it.
 *
 * **The forbidden-field test below was rewritten in the SAME change, and that is the load-bearing
 * part of this widening.** It used to compare field names against the exact string `"diagnosis"`,
 * which `tentativeDiagnosis` does not equal: adding the field would have left every assertion in
 * this file green without anybody widening anything, and the guard would have been STEPPED AROUND
 * rather than passed. It now matches on the diagnosis STEM, so the new field trips it, and the
 * field is then let through by being named in `AUTHORISED_PERSON_FACTS` — one line, one owner, one
 * date. A future `diagnosisDetail`, `provisionalDiagnosis` or `notes` still fails.
 *
 * **AND WIDENED A FOURTH TIME ON 2026-09-01, TO NINETEEN — `specialling`.** Owner ruling 1 of the
 * fourteen: one-to-one nursing is recorded as THE WARD'S STAFFING OF THE BED, not as a fact about
 * the patient, and that distinction is the ruling rather than a gloss on it. So this field sits in
 * the `dischargeConfirmedAt` category — the ward's own act — and not in `tentativeDiagnosis`'s,
 * which needed the standing no-diagnosis rule reversed before it could exist. It records that the
 * ward has committed a nurse to this bed; it records no reason, no level, no risk and no
 * assessment, and nothing may read it as though it did.
 *
 * **What it fixes is a live defect rather than a display one.** `Unit.speciallingCapacity` was
 * authored per unit and changed by no reducer path, and `Admission` held nothing of this shape at
 * all, so the only question anything could ask was whether a ward had ANY one-to-one capacity —
 * never whether it had any LEFT. A ward that can watch one person one-to-one accepted an unlimited
 * number. The remaining figure is now DERIVED from the beds (`remainingSpeciallingCapacity`) and
 * `PULL_PATIENT` refuses when it reaches nought.
 *
 * `specialling` contains no forbidden stem, so it needs no `AUTHORISED_PERSON_FACTS` entry — and
 * it must never acquire one, because a field that needed such an entry would be a different field:
 * a clinical fact about the person rather than a record of what the ward is staffing.

   * It used to compare each declared field name against exact strings, one of which was
   * `"diagnosis"`. `tentativeDiagnosis` is not equal to `"diagnosis"`, so the field could have been
   * added, shipped and rendered without a single assertion in this file going red — the guard would
   * have been walked around, not passed, and the widening above would have been a widening only in
   * the comments. That is the exact failure this test exists to make impossible, so the matching is

   * `diagnos`, `note`, `comment`, `name`, `dob`, `address`, `text`, `history` or `patient` trips it,
   * wherever in the name it appears.
   *
   * One field is then let through, by name, in `AUTHORISED_PERSON_FACTS`. Adding a line there is
   * the deliberate act — it costs an owner, a date and a reason, and it cannot be done by accident
   * while adding a field. `provisionalDiagnosis`, `diagnosisDetail`, `notes`, `clinicalNote`,
