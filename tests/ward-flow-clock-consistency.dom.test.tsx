/**
 * 🔴 **RE-POINTED AT `MovementsScreen` ON 2026-09-05.** This file rendered `<WardModeWorkspace
 * mode="movements" />`; MERGE 03 replaced that mode with `MovementsScreen` and re-pointed the
 * route, so the pin went on passing over a screen no coordinator can open.
 *
 * **The property is unchanged and is not about wording:** a board that displays elapsed time must
 * read the LIVE shared clock, not a value captured when the module was imported. `ADVANCE_CLOCK`
 * folds into `clockOffsetMinutes` in the provider and therefore into the `now` every screen reads;
 * a screen that reached for the frozen `NOW_ANCHOR` constant instead would render correct-looking
 * durations forever while the rest of the app moved on — two screens disagreeing about one
 * patient, which is the defect this file was written for.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NOTHING ELSE ON THIS SCREEN ADVANCES THE CLOCK, WHICH IS WHY THIS FILE STILL EARNS ITS
 * PLACE.** `ward-movements-screen.dom.test.tsx` renders at a pinned `initialNow` and never moves
 * it — every one of its assertions is a photograph. Measured by mutation, 2026-09-05, source hash
 * `ca510d77` before and after: replacing the screen's `now` with the imported `NOW_ANCHOR`
 * constant left all 15 of its cases GREEN, and failed *"moves an open movement's journey time when
 * the shared clock advances"* here, alone and by name.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE SECOND CASE IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE SAME MECHANISM AND HAS NEVER BEEN CHECKED UNDER A
 * MOVING CLOCK.** `StageRow` freezes a closed movement's clock at `closure.at` rather than
 * counting on to `now`. That is guarded today only at a standstill, where "frozen at closure.at"
 * and "counting to now" are two fixed numbers that happen to differ. Under an advancing clock the
 * distinction becomes the behaviour a reader actually relies on: the closed row must not move
 * while the open row beside it does. Its own control: `clockEnd = now` fails *"leaves a closed
 * movement's frozen clock where it is while the clock moves around it"*, alone and by name.
 *
 * Expected durations are computed with the screen's own `splitDuration` against the record's own
 * `openedAt`/`closure.at`, never written in — a fixture change moves the expectation with it.
