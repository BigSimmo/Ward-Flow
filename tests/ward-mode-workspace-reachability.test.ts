/**
 * 🔴 **A TEST CAN OUTLIVE THE SCREEN IT TESTS, AND NOTHING GOES RED WHEN IT DOES.**
 *
 * Found during the 2026-09-05 fold, and it was created BY that fold rather than by anyone's
 * mistake. Ward Builder Two replaced two `WardModeWorkspace` modes with their own screens and
 * re-pointed the routes: `/mockups/ward-flow/capacity` now renders `CapacityScreen`, and
 * `/mockups/ward-flow/movements` renders `MovementsScreen`. Both changes are improvements and both
 * merged cleanly.
 *
 * **What merged just as cleanly was four test files still rendering `<WardModeWorkspace
 * mode="capacity" />` — a surface no route reaches any more.** Measured at the fold: zero
 * production callers for that mode, four test files exercising it. Those tests do not fail. They
 * cannot fail. They pass forever, describing a screen no user can open, while the screen a user
 * DOES open carries a fraction of the coverage — and the suite's total stays reassuringly high the
 * whole time.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE DANGEROUS HALF IS NOT THE WASTED TESTS. IT IS THE CLINICAL GUARDS AMONG THEM.**
 * `ward-capacity-freshness-source.dom.test.tsx` and `ward-capacity-sexmix-release.dom.test.tsx`
 * assert real safety properties — that a capacity figure says who confirmed it, and that a sex-mix
 * note fires when occupancy and the recorded mix disagree. **Pointed at a dead surface, those are
 * green statements about a screen nobody sees.** A reader counting green ticks concludes the live
 * capacity screen has freshness attribution. Nothing tells them otherwise.
 *
 * This guard is deliberately about REACHABILITY, not about wording, structure or coverage counts,
 * so a redesign that moves a mode to its own screen does not fight it — it just has to say so here.

/**
 * 🔴 **TWO PATTERNS, BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE MATCHED JSX ONLY AND REPORTED ZERO WHILE TWO FILES WERE
 * STILL RENDERING RETIRED MODES.**
 *
 * The original was `/WardModeWorkspace\s+mode=["']…["']/` — the JSX attribute form, and nothing
 * else. `tests/ward-landmarks.test.ts` and `tests/ward-nav.test.ts` build their route maps with
 * `createElement(WardModeWorkspace, { mode: "queue" })`, which is the same render written the other
 * way, and **this scan could not see either of them.** On 2026-09-06 the guard was green, and read
 * as "every orphaned mode has been answered", while `/queue` and `/exceptions` were still mapped to
 * a workspace mode no route reaches.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE GREEN WAS A PROPERTY OF THE PATTERN, NOT OF THE TREE** — and a guard reporting an empty
 * list is the least likely thing anybody re-derives, because there is nothing to look at. The
 * anti-vacuity check below did not help: it floors on the scan finding renders SOMEWHERE, and it
 * was finding plenty, all of them JSX.
 *
 * **An alias defeats a name-matching detector.** `createElement` is not an exotic spelling; it is
 * what any test that stores components in a table has to use, which is exactly the kind of file
 * that outlives the screen it points at.

/*
 * ⚠️ **COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED, AND THIS GUARD INVENTED A FALSE ORPHAN BEFORE THEY WERE (2026-09-05).**
 *
 * The moment somebody documented this guard properly — a comment in `ward-delays-screen.dom.test.tsx`
 * explaining that a vocabulary pin had been carried across FROM `<WardModeWorkspace mode="exceptions" />`
 * — the scan matched the literal inside that prose and reported the delays screen as rendering an
 * unreachable mode. **A file that renders nothing was named as an offender because it described the
 * problem accurately.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE FAILURE DIRECTION IS WHAT MAKES THIS WORTH A COMMENT OF ITS OWN.** A guard that invents a
 * violation trains people to distrust it and, eventually, to widen it until the real cases fall out —
 * and it punishes exactly the behaviour this project wants, which is writing down why a test points
 * where it points. **A mention is not a render.**
 *
 * Stripping is the right answer HERE specifically because the question is "does this file render the
 * mode", and commented-out code renders nothing. That is not a general licence: `ward-statistics-sections`
 * deliberately does NOT strip, because its assertions are about the source RECORD rather than about
 * what executes, and a pin there guards that difference.
