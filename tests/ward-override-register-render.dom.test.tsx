/**
 * THE OVERRIDE REGISTER, READ RATHER THAN MERELY STORED — and the boundary that keeps it an
 * accountability record instead of an audit trail.
 *
 * Owner decision OD-3: a coordinator may overrule a failing bed-matching gate, the reason is kept
 * on `Movement.overrides`, and the record is **visible to the party overridden**. Both derivations
 * that read it back (`allOverrides`, `overridesAgainstUnit`) were fully covered by
 * `tests/ward-override-register.test.ts` and called by nothing but that file — an accountability
 * record no human being could reach. This file covers the read side on screen.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## Why the "another ward cannot see it" render test is NOT the guard, and what is
 *
 * "No path exists by which one ward can obtain another's overrides" is a negative existential, and
 * no render assertion can establish one. The leak OD-3 names appears "the moment somebody adds a
 * column, a debug panel, or a styling change that reveals a hidden row" — none of which exist
 * today. So a test that renders ward B and finds ward A's reason absent passes **on the leaking
 * construction too**, as long as that construction happens not to paint the extra row this
 * afternoon. It is a check on today's markup wearing the name of a check on the property.
 *
 * The property is structural: does another ward's data ever REACH the ward screen. If it never
 * enters scope, no future column or stylesheet can reveal it, and the rule holds by construction
 * rather than by vigilance. So the render assertions below are kept — they catch the crude failure
 * — and the block "the ward screen cannot reach the whole register" is what actually establishes
 * it, following `tests/ward-referral-screen-boundary.test.ts`, this repository's own FD-23 guard,
 * including its non-vacuity discipline: a check that cannot fail is worse than no check.

 *
 * 🔴 THE FAILING TEST MOVED BETWEEN FILES AND NOTHING IN EITHER FILE CHANGED. All three reds
 * were `STACK_TRACE_ERROR` with no assertion, no expected and no received — vitest losing the
 * cause at registration time, which is what a starved timer looks like from the outside.
 *
 * MEASURED SOLO, on an otherwise idle machine:
 *
 *     ward-mutation-harness-reachable   28.09 s of a 30,000 ms ceiling   94%
 *     ward-override-register-render     21.5–28.6 s of the same ceiling   ~72–95%
 *
 * So neither file ever had headroom. A test at 94% of its budget with the machine to itself
 * reddens on any contention at all, and this machine runs 90–107 node processes at rest.
 *
 * 🔴 THAT FAILURE MODE IS WHY THIS IS RAISED RATHER THAN THE ASSERTIONS WEAKENED, and the
 * precedent is `tests/ward-flow-chat-control.test.ts:278–299`, which met the identical signature on
 * 2026-09-04 and wrote it down: "A gate that is red when the machine is busy and green when it is
 * quiet teaches everyone to re-run it, and A PASSING RE-RUN IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A REAL PASS."
 * ⚠️ Nobody consulted that comment for SEVEN DAYS; the same diagnosis was re-derived from
 * scratch tonight. Run D above is exactly the green re-run it warns against being read as an answer.
 *
 * 🔴 CORRECTED 2026-09-11. This sentence originally named an interval FIVE TIMES TOO LONG - a
 * count of weeks where the true figure is the seven days above. The comment it cites states its
 * own date in its second line, "quiet machine, 2026-09-04", and today is 2026-09-11; the
 * subtraction was never done. Committed, and caught by a second reader who checked the arithmetic
 * rather than the point - inside the sentence complaining that nobody read the neighbouring
 * comment carefully.
 *
 * The point survives: seven days is still long enough for a written diagnosis to go unread while
 * somebody re-derives it from scratch, which is the whole reason it is cited here. What the
 * inflated figure did was make ordinary forgetting sound like neglect, and the next reader would
 * have taken it as measured, because every other number in this block is.
 *
 * ⚠️ The wrong figure is DELIBERATELY NOT SPELLED above. A correction that quotes the string it
 * removes puts that string back in the file, so a search asking "is the wrong number gone?"
 * answers no - the repair documenting itself out of its own verification. Do not helpfully restore
 * the original wording here for clarity; describing it is the point.
 *
 * 120_000 is ~4x the measured solo time: ample headroom for load, while a genuinely hung test still
 * fails in two minutes rather than never. ✅ Do not raise it further without measuring again —
 * the measurement above is the justification, not the value.

 * `import allOverrides from "…/ward-derivations"`, because the local name the importer chose
 * happens to collide with the forbidden word itself: Babel emits the specifier's local binding
 * as an `Identifier` named `allOverrides`, and `FORBIDDEN_REGISTER_READS` already contains that
 * string. Proved live for this file, 2026-09-03: with `export default allOverrides;` added to
 * `ward-derivations.ts` and `import allOverrides from "@/…/ward-derivations"; void allOverrides;`
 * added to `ward-screen.tsx`, the two identifier-scan tests above went red on their own, with no
 * new check at all. That is a coincidence of spelling, not a structural catch — `import zqBinding
 * from "…/ward-derivations"; void zqBinding;` in the same spot left every test in this file green,
 * because "zqBinding" is not a word `FORBIDDEN_REGISTER_READS` has ever heard of. A default import
 * binds the ENTIRE module to whatever local name the importer picks, so a scan that reads names
 * catches this leak only when the leaker happens to reuse the original name — which is exactly
 * when a leak is least likely to be named, not most.
 *
 * The fix is to stop reading names and start reading RESOLUTION: does the specifier of a default
 * import, resolved on disk from the importing file, land on `DEFINES_THE_READS` — regardless of
 * what the importer calls the binding. Copied from `namespaceOrDefaultReferralImports` and
 * `resolveLocalImport` in `tests/ward-referral-screen-boundary.test.ts` — this repo's own FD-23
 * guard already solved the identical problem for the referral record, and a second independent
 * module-resolution implementation is a liability, not a second opinion. `resolveModule` is the
 * shared resolver `runtimeGraph()` itself is built from, so this check walks the exact same graph
