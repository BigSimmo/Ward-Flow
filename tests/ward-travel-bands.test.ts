/**
 * Phase 8 Task 1. What this file may and may not assert, because getting that boundary wrong is
 * the whole risk of the phase.
 *
 * `SYNTHETIC_TRAVEL_BANDS` sits beside REAL hospital names and every value in it is invented.
 * Nobody has measured or checked the travel time between any Western Australian region and any
 * hospital in that table, and the values were chosen to exercise the four bands rather than to
 * resemble geography. The day somebody replaces them with checked figures, replacing that one
 * file's values must be the whole change.
 *
 * So NO test here may assert a specific band for a specific place. A test reading
 * `expect(travelBand("Kimberley", "RPH")).toBe("three_hours_or_more")` would quietly promote an
 * invented placeholder into a pinned expectation, and the owner's future correction would arrive
 * as a test failure — which is exactly the pressure that turns a placeholder into a claim.
 *
 * Everything below therefore asserts MECHANISM (which field is read, what an unrecorded pair
 * returns, that the labels derive from the array) or STRUCTURE (counts, gaps, subset relations).
 * Where a test needs a concrete pair it SEARCHES the fixture for one with the required shape and
 * fails loudly if none exists, rather than naming a region and a hospital in the assertion.
