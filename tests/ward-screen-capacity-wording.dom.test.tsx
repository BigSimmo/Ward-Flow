/**
 * THE WARD SCREEN MUST NOT CALL `capacity.available` "FREE".
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DEFECT. `unitCapacity()` computes `available = min(allocatable, empty)` — beds that are
 * empty AND that the ward is offering — and on the very next line `held = empty - available`, which
 * is the count of beds that ARE empty and are NOT in that figure. The hero called `available`
 * "free bed(s) on this ward right now". Whenever `held > 0` that states fewer free beds than the
 * ward has empty, and the contradiction was already on the page: the breakdown below renders
 * `Ready {available}` beside `Held {held}` as two different things.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE FLOOR IS `held > 0` AND NOT "a unit exists". On a unit with `held === 0` the words
 * "free" and "ready" describe the same set, so such a unit cannot tell the defect from the repair
 * and a test walking only those would pass against the wording it exists to reject.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DID NOT DECIDE — AND THE OWNER HAS SINCE DECIDED IT. This block said
 * the product's word for the quantity was an open question, and cited `board/ward-board.tsx`
 * rendering "beds you can fill today" as the rival term. **OWNER RULING R-B-09, 2026-09-04:
 * "Ready", everywhere** — one word replacing seven renderings of `min(allocatable, empty)`
 * (`docs/ward-flow/owner-rulings-2026-09-04-decision-batch.md`). The board now renders "ready
 * bed(s)"; the old phrase survives only in prose describing what its header used to say, which is
 * history and not a competing live term.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHAT THIS FILE PINS IS UNCHANGED BY THAT, AND IS NARROWER THAN THE RULING.** It pins that
 * ONE SCREEN uses ONE WORD for ONE VALUE — correct before the ruling and correct after it, because
 * a screen contradicting itself is a defect whatever the chosen word is. It cannot see a SECOND
 * screen using a different word, because it never renders one. The product-wide half of R-B-09 is
 * `tests/ward-capacity-figure-one-word.test.ts`, written on 2026-09-06 after four rendered strings
 * were found still naming this figure by a retired name — the rename had followed the label
 * constant, so it moved every label and no sentence.
 *
 * If the word is ever changed again, the right change is here and in the breakdown together, and
 * this test will say so by failing on the mismatch rather than on the term.
