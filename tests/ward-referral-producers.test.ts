/**
 * 🔴 EVERY FIELD ON A REFERRAL MUST HAVE SOMETHING THAT CAN WRITE IT.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THREE FIELDS IN ONE NIGHT LANDED WITH NO PRODUCER**, which makes it a pattern rather than
 * three slips:
 *
 * ```
 * edId + purpose   landed, nothing could write them  -> the intake form was fixed after the fact
 * triagedAt        landed, nothing could write it    -> this file, and the event field beside it
 * suburb           landed WITH a producer and a reducer check  <- what the other two should look like
 * ```
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE FAILURE IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY OTHER GATE.** A field with no producer typechecks, has
 * passing tests against hand-authored fixtures, and reads as complete in the model. The only thing
 * that reveals it is a screen rendering the absent branch forever — **and a screen showing "not in
 * department yet" for every patient looks exactly like correct handling of a legitimate case.**
 * `R46`: a thing built before its input exists cannot be built wrong, only empty, and empty is
 * indistinguishable from working. Found by Ward Referrals measuring the reducer rather than reading
 * the model.
 *
 * The check is deliberately structural rather than a list somebody maintains: it reads `Referral`'s
 * own field names out of `ward-model.ts` and requires each one to be written by the event that
 * creates a referral. A field added tomorrow is caught tomorrow, by nobody remembering anything.
 *
 * **A field that genuinely cannot come from the front door belongs in `WRITTEN_ELSEWHERE` with the
 * event that writes it named** — that list is the honest exception, and it is short on purpose.
