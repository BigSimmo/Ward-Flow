/**
 * THE TRIAGE BAR, and the one failure it is most likely to have.
 *
 * A sibling panel shipped "Kimberley 28 people" on a twenty-bed ward this morning. Its derivation
 * was right and all nine of its assertions passed; it had been handed the whole network's 267
 * admissions instead of one ward's, and no test of a derivation can see a caller passing it the
 * wrong set. So these tests check the RENDERED figures against a per-unit derivation computed here,
 * for all 23 seeded units, and additionally check that each figure is POSSIBLE for a ward of that
 * size rather than merely equal to something.
 *
 * They also pin the vocabulary. The six labels must be `CAPACITY_FIGURE_LABELS`' own strings, so a
 * hardcoded copy in the board — which would pass any check that read the board's own markup back —
 * fails here instead.
