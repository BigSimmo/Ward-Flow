/**
 * THE COMMUNITY TEAM INDEX, JUDGED FROM THE RENDERED DOM RATHER THAN FROM SOURCE TEXT.
 *
 * `tests/ward-community-index.test.ts` proves the markup the index emits. This file proves the two
 * things only a live tree can testify to:
 *
 *  1. **That the index itself is reachable**, which outranks everything else in this task. An index
 *     that links every derived team and that nothing links to leaves every one of them exactly as
 *     reachable as they were — while every scan and count starts reporting them healthy, which is
 *     strictly worse than the honest "none of them are reachable" it replaces. Reachability is
 *     transitive. Tests are not.
 *  2. **That each team link is not inert.** A link inside a `hidden` ancestor, an `aria-hidden`
 *     subtree or a closed `<details>` is in the DOM, passes every markup scan, and cannot be reached
 *     by a person — which is the same class of defect this whole page exists to fix.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE LIMIT OF THIS FILE, WRITTEN DOWN SO THE NEXT READER DOES NOT ASSUME IT WAS COVERED.**
 * jsdom does not apply the CSS module, so nothing here can testify about `display: none`,
 * `visibility: hidden`, zero height, or a link sitting under an overlay. Ward Flow has already
 * shipped exactly that defect once — the rail's bottom block overlapped its last links and
 * swallowed their clicks while every link stayed in the DOM and the whole unit suite stayed green.
 * Only a browser journey can close that, and no assertion below should be read as having closed it.

   * inverted the verdict, so the suite stayed green for exactly as long as the index was
   * unreachable and went RED the moment the nav entry landed. That red was the notification the
   * tripwire existed to send, not a regression, and the response it asked for was to delete the
   * `.fails` — which is what happened here. **The response is never to re-add it.**
   *
   * What it guards now is the thing that outranks everything else in this file: an index that links
   * every derived team and that nothing links to leaves every one of those teams exactly as
   * reachable as they were, while every scan and count starts reporting them healthy. Reachability
   * is transitive; a page that is not itself reachable confers none of it. So this fails if the
   * `community` entry is ever removed from `WARD_NAV` or its href drifts from the route on disk.
   *
   * ONE assertion in this body and nothing else, which was the discipline the inverted verdict
   * required and is worth keeping: the rail is rendered at collection above, so a rail that throws
   * fails this file loudly rather than passing here for the wrong reason.
