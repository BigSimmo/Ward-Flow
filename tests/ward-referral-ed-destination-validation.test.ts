/**
 * A REFERRAL TO AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT MUST NAME A REAL ONE.
 *
 * `RECEIVE_REFERRAL` membership-checks `ageBand`, `sex`, `source`, `homeRegion` and `urgency`, and
 * resolves `originSiteCode` against the real network — with a comment saying exactly why: *"resolved
 * against the real network rather than merely checked for non-emptiness, so '12 Wellington St,
 * Perth' cannot pass as a code."* When the ED arm gained `edId` and `purpose` it got neither
 * treatment, so **a referral could queue at an empty or invented department and read like an answer.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THIS IS THE CHECK THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE SHORTCUT TWO SESSIONS AGREED MUST NOT BE
 * MADE.** When the destination arm grew required fields, three call sites stopped compiling, and the
 * tempting repair was a cast or an `edId: ""` stub — a form offering a destination the application
 * cannot construct, while looking finished. Ward Referrals mutation-tested that stub and found it
 * broke only its own new screen-level guards and **no pre-existing test anywhere**. A screen guard is
 * the wrong last line: it is one component away from being bypassed, and the reducer is the thing
 * every path goes through.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NON-EMPTINESS IS NOT THE CHECK.** `edId: "not-a-department"` is as wrong as `edId: ""` and
 * far more convincing — it survives every truthiness test, renders as a plausible identifier, and
 * queues a real person at a hospital that does not exist. The assertions below use both, because a
 * guard written against the empty string alone passes the case that would actually ship.
