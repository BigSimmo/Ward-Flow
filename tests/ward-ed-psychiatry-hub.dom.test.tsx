/**
 * THE ED PSYCHIATRY HUB — the inbox, the outbox, and the producer that makes an ED destination
 * possible at all.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than more assertions in `ward-referral-ed-destination.test.ts`
 *
 * ⚠️ **That file hand-builds its destinations with a local helper, so it proves the TYPE is
 * expressive and nothing whatever about the system.** It was green on a branch where no fixture and
 * no code path in `src/` could construct an emergency-department destination — the arm existed, and
 * the application could not produce one. Reading the fixtures said so; `npm run typecheck` said so
 * too, in three errors, the moment the arm gained `edId` and `purpose`.
 *
 * **So every assertion here runs against something the APPLICATION built:** either a referral that
 * came out of `wardFlowReducer` through its own `RECEIVE_REFERRAL` write path, or one raised by
 * driving the real intake form's real controls. Nothing below asserts about an object literal.
 *
 * ## The three flows, and which of them has a producer today
 *
 * `REFERRAL_PURPOSES` has three members and the spec fixes each to a referrer:
 *
 *   community → ED           `bed`                  ← the intake form, every source it offers
 *   ED psychiatry → itself   `psychiatric_review`    ← `FD-16`'s self-addressed inbox
 *   ward → ED                `medical_assessment`
 *
 * **Only the first has a producer in `src/` today**, and that is a reported gap rather than
 * something this suite papers over: `RECEIVE_REFERRAL` is the one event that creates a `Referral`
 * and its `EVENT_ROLE` entry is `["community"]`, so neither ED psychiatry nor a ward can raise one.
 * The selector tests below therefore drive the reducer directly — which is still the application's
 * own write path, with real ids and real addressing states — and the DOM tests drive the hub.

 * THE WORDS, ASSERTED WITHOUT A SCREEN — including the branch no screen can reach.
 *
 * ⚠️ **ONE BRANCH OF THE THREE STILL HAS NO REACHABLE CALLER, AND IT IS NO LONGER THE SAME ONE.**
 * Until `RF-009` was seeded, `triagedAt` was authored only on referrals addressed to psychiatric
 * wards, so the department clock's PRESENT branch could not be reached from this hub at all. It can
 * now, and it is asserted on the rendered screen further down this file. What remains unreachable is
 * the STOPPED referral clock: stopping requires `triagedAt >= raisedAt`, no seeded ED-addressed
 * referral has that, and `RECEIVE_REFERRAL` — the only event that creates a `Referral` — has no
 * `triagedAt` field for a screen to supply one. That is a reported gap, and it is why these
 * assertions are made against the hub's own formatting function as well as against rendered rows:
 * a branch nothing reaches is a branch nothing checks, and this one decides the wording of the two
 * lies the model's own doc comments name (a zero for an absent clock, a stopped span worded as a
 * live wait).
 *
 * The clock values below are hand-written and are NOT a referral fixture: they are the three
 * outputs `referralClocks` is already proven to produce in `tests/ward-referral-clocks.test.ts`,
 * fed to the function under test here, which is presentation and nothing else.
