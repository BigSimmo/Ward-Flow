 * times in a comment written to EXPLAIN the print rule: once quoting `.screen { background: none }`
 * and once quoting a `body` colour declaration with its closing brace. Both times the guard matched
 * the prose, truncated its extract and went red on a stylesheet whose CSS was correct.
 *

 * offset below still points at the real file. A guard that names the wrong line is worse than one

/**
 * `morning.module.css`'s own `@media print` block documents that `handover.module.css` — this
 * file's own documented starting point — had the identical gap and was flagged as a pre-existing
 * issue outside that task's scope. This test closes it here.
 *
 * `.screen` and `.governanceBanner` each carry their own explicit `background: var(--surface)` /
 * `var(--surface-chrome)` for on-screen dark-theme support (`ckb-v2-tokens.css`'s `.dark .ckb-v2`
 * ramp resolves those to near-black — `#12161a` / `#0e1216`). The global print reset in
 * `globals.css` only resets `html`/`body`'s own background; CSS `background` does not inherit and
 * an element's own explicit declaration is not overridden by an ancestor's, so without a
 * print-scoped reset here, printing the page while the app is in dark mode paints the whole
 * screen container and the governance banner band as a dark ink-on-dark-paper band instead of the
 * white sheet the rest of this print block is built to produce.
 *
 * Measured live with Playwright (`emulateMedia({ media: "print", colorScheme: "dark" })`) against
 * the running dev server before and after the fix:
 *   before — `.screen` background-color `rgb(18, 22, 26)`, `.governanceBanner` background-color
 *   `rgb(14, 18, 22)`.
 *   after  — both resolve to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` (transparent, i.e. the white page shows through).
