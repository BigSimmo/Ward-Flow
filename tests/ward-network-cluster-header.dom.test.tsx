 * ⚠️ **THE CLUSTER HEADER MUST MEAN WHAT ITS CARDS MEAN — owner ruling, 2026-09-04.**
 *
 * It summed raw `unit.allocatable.value` across a service while every card beneath it showed
 * `unitCapacity(...).available` = `min(allocatable, empty)`, both labelled "ready". The header was
 * the sum of nothing on the screen.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND A TEST COMPARING HEADER TO CARDS WOULD HAVE PASSED AGAINST THE UNFIXED CODE.** Measured
 * across every service in the seed before this was written: the raw and clamped sums are IDENTICAL
 * (9/9, 4/4, 8/8, 4/4, 2/2). Divergence needs `allocatable > empty`, and no seeded unit has that —
 * **a held bed puts allocatable BELOW empty, so it cannot cause this**, which is the mechanism I
 * first got backwards and reported wrongly.
 *
 * So this drives the state first with a real `CONFIRM_CAPACITY` event — the path the reducer's own
 * `PATIENT_ARRIVED` guard documents as reachable — and compares the header against a figure
 * computed independently from live state, never against a number written down here.
