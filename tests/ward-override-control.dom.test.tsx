/**
 * `ward-screen.tsx`'s refusal alert (see `tests/ward-screen-refusal-surface.dom.test.tsx`) now
 * grows a reason control when, and only when, the engine's own refusal names
 * `OVERRIDE_REASON_REQUIRED` — a judgement gate a recorded reason can actually get past. A refusal
 * on a PHYSICAL fact (no specialling capacity, no allocatable bed) must show the alert and NO
 * control, because no reason buys anything there; offering one would be a false promise.
 *
 * Two real, measured movement/unit pairs drive every case, exactly as
 * `ward-screen-refusal-surface.dom.test.tsx` does — never a hand-authored fixture edit:
 *
 * - WF-319 into Great Southern Acute Psychiatric Unit (`alb-adult-open`) fails ONLY `specialling`, a physical fact.
 * - WF-009 into Mabu Liyan / Broome Mental Health Unit (`brm-adult-secure`) fails `["forensic", "specialling"]`;
 *   `forensic` is a judgement gate (`SUITABILITY_GATES`), so it is the one an override answers.
