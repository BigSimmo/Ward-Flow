 * `BedReleaseBlocker` enum about a bed being freed and merely shares the name — was audited as a
 * candidate for being DERIVED from `stage`, `transport`, `acceptedUnitId` and `closure`. The owner
 * ruled against it, and these five values are the evidence:
 *
 *   - The first two are TWO DIFFERENT SITUATIONS THAT BOTH HAVE NO BLOCKER. A derivation yields one
 *     value when nothing is blocking; the field is the only thing that says which of the two it is.
 *   - The last three name activity by parties this model has no field for at all — a family, a
 *     specialling roster, an escort provider. There is nothing in state to compute them from.
 *
 * A later change that narrows this field to a chosen vocabulary, or replaces it with a derivation,
 * loses these by a different route than deriving would and passes every other test in the suite,
 * because no other test asserts a value the model can no longer represent. This one does.
