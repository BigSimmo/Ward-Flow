// 🔴 **A DELAY CAUSE'S NOTE MUST NOT CALL ITS OWN EVENT BY A NAME ITS TITLE HAS RETIRED.**
//
// `bed_pull_expired` carried `title: "Bed pull expired"` beside `note: "the hold lapsed before the
// bed was used"` until 2026-09-06 — **the same event named two ways inside one object literal**,
// and that object is the authority the rest of the tree cites for the word "pull". I cited its
// title to another chat as the precedent for a rename while never reading its note.
//
// ⚠️ **NOTHING IN THE REPOSITORY ASSERTED ANYTHING ABOUT ANY NOTE.** Not this one — none of them.
// Every existing guard pins titles: `ward-delays-screen.dom.test.tsx` requires "Bed pull expired"
// on the screen and forbids "Bed hold expired", and both passed happily for as long as the note
// underneath contradicted the title above it. **A half-renamed entry looks finished from every
// angle anybody was looking from.** Found by Ward Verifier, who then measured that
// `awaiting_bed_ready` and `awaiting_coordinator` were equally unguarded.
//
// ⚠️ **THIS IS NOT A BAN ON THE WORD "hold", AND MUST NOT BECOME ONE.** "The hold lapsed before the
// bed was used" is honest English about a bed RESERVATION rather than about detaining a person, and
// a repository-wide ban would go red on truthful copy — at which point the tempting repair is to
// weaken the guard, and the honest guards go with it in the same tidy-up. The rule below is
// RELATIONAL: a note may say "hold" freely under a title that makes no claim about the event's
// name, and may not under a title that has already called the same event a pull. The second control
// asserts exactly that, so a future narrowing to a bare word-ban goes red rather than passing.
//
// A rename tomorrow needs one line changed in `RETIRED_BY_TITLE` — not a rewritten assertion.
//
// Being a table-walking test it imports the copy table directly rather than `delayGroups()`, which
// returns only causes the fixture populates. An entry nothing renders is exactly where a
// half-renamed pair survives longest.
