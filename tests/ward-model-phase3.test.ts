  /**
   * DELIBERATELY WEAKENED on 2026-08-24, and the weakening is the change, not an oversight.
   *
   * This used to pin the 1A/3B invariant in both directions — a movement on 1A has no
   * `examination`, a movement on 3B has one with outcome `inpatient_order`. That WAS the rule the
   * product owner asked to remove: the software no longer decides which form a patient is on, so
   * the form and the examination are independently recorded facts and neither implies the other.
   * Asserting the old invariant would now be asserting a rule the system does not have.
   *
   * What remains is the honest, weaker statement — the model RECORDS a form and infers none —
   * plus a non-vacuity floor, so this still goes red if the fixture stops carrying forms
   * altogether or starts carrying a code nobody declared.

  // post-examination deadline is recorded for a 3B. That was established while
  // this fixture still gave a Form 1A one. That 1A `dueAt` was never a real statutory figure —
  // it was an unverified number an earlier agent wrote into ward-model.ts from its own
  // recollection of the Act, not from the clinician or product owner. Put to the product owner
  // directly on 2026-08-23, the instruction was narrower than a corrected figure: drop the
  // legal countdown from this model entirely rather than get its number right ("please can you
  // leave the legal part and just start a clock once the patient arrives to ED. Keep it simple
  // for now"). So a 1A now carries no `dueAt` either — the same absence a 3B has always carried.
