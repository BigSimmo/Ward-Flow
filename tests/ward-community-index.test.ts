/**
 * THE COMMUNITY TEAM INDEX, MEASURED FROM WHAT IT ACTUALLY RENDERS.
 *
 * Same "SSR-string component test" pattern `tests/ward-nav.test.ts` and
 * `tests/ward-landmarks.test.ts` use, for the same reason: this file is `.test.ts`, so it collects
 * under `vitest.config.mts`'s "node" project rather than jsdom, and `renderToStaticMarkup` renders
 * the real component tree to a string without needing `document`. `next/link` is mocked because
 * `ClinicalRail` renders anchors through it and there is no App Router context here.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL RATHER THAN AN ENTRY IN `ward-nav.test.ts`'s SOURCE SCAN.** That
 * scan proves reachability by regex-searching `src/` for concrete, literally quoted hrefs. Every
 * link this index renders is built inside a `.map()`, which that scan classifies as "built" rather
 * than "concrete" and counts as **zero**. The same is already true of `/wards`: `WardIndex` links
 * twenty-three of twenty-three wards and the scan still reads the route as unreachable, which is why
 * that route's orphan entry was rewritten to point at where the real proof lives. So this file IS
 * the proof for `community/[teamId]`, and no amount of tidying the source scan will make it
 * unnecessary.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT PIN: the number of teams.** Assertions here read the
 * expectation from `COMMUNITY_TEAM_PAGES` and the page renders from `COMMUNITY_TEAM_PAGES`, so both
 * sides move together — the fixture losing a team would keep every assertion below green, and
 * correctly so. That is not a hole in this file; it is the division of
 * labour. **The fixture-size pin belongs in the fixture's own suite**
 * (`tests/ward-community-hub.test.ts`, which already pins the derivation and the slug uniqueness),
 * so that a data change fails as "the fixture changed" and never as "the index lost a team", and the
 * two failures stay tellable apart. That file is owned by another change and **the exact-size pin is
 * not in it yet** — recorded here so the gap is visible rather than assumed closed.
 *
 * What these assertions DO catch, which no count ever did: an href built wrongly. Set equality
 * against the derived ids fails the moment the page composes a URL the route cannot serve, and the
 * duplicate check fails on a team rendered twice — neither of which a fixture-size pin would notice.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE INDEX'S OWN REACHABILITY IS NOT MEASURED HERE.** It is measured in
 * `tests/ward-community-index.dom.test.tsx`, as an `it.fails` tripwire, and it outranks everything in
 * this file: an index that links every derived team and that nothing links to leaves every one of
 * them exactly as reachable as they were, while every count starts reporting them healthy.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THAT IS WHY NO TEAM COUNT IS WRITTEN INTO THIS FILE'S PROSE EITHER.** Until 2026-09-01
 * this comment and the page's own doc comment both said "sixty-five". It was true, it was a
 * property of the SEED rather than of either file, and a seed edit would have falsified both with
 * nothing going red — the class `statistics-derivations.ts` records as having falsified itself
 * silently four times on one paragraph. The last block below is what stops it coming back.

 * beside the guard and assert the predicate FIRES on it.** Then a future narrowing cannot pass
 * silently, because the corpus runs on every change.
 *
 * ⚠️ **ITS OWN FAILURE MODE, so this is not a free win: a fixture written from MEMORY of the defect
 * gives a positive control that passes for the wrong reason.** The two below are copied verbatim

/**
 * ⚠️ **LODGED HERE FOR A FILE-OWNERSHIP REASON, NOT A TOPICAL ONE.** This block pins wording on

 * was being held by another change when this correction was made, and the only test files this task
 * could create were `tests/ward-community-index*`. **Move this block into the hub suite when that
 * file is free**; nothing about it belongs to the index.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHAT IT PINS, AND WHY A PIN RATHER THAN A COMMENT.** Until 2026-09-01 the community hub said,
 * in bold, inside its follow-up absence notice, that whether follow-up has been arranged "is not
 * recorded anywhere in this prototype. There is no field for it, no way to set one, and nothing that
 * could be counted." **Every clause of that was false**, and it was false on a clinical-adjacent page
 * whose entire purpose is being believed by a reader with no way to check it.
 *
 * Measured on this worktree at the time of the correction:
 *
 *  - `Admission.followUp: FollowUpRecord | null` — `ward-admissions.ts`, around `:452`, and present
 *    in the field-presence map around `:484`.
 *  - `FollowUpRecord = { state: FollowUpState; recordedAt: Instant; recordedBy: string }`, with the
 *    vocabulary `FOLLOW_UP_STATES = ["arranged", "not_arranged"]` (`ward-admissions.ts`, around
 *    `:159`).
 *  - The seed sets a real record on two departed admissions (`ward-admissions-seed.ts:733`, `:770`).
 *
 * What IS true is narrower and sharper: the field has **no producer and no consumer**. Nothing reads
 * it, and the sole mention in `ward-flow-reducer.ts` writes `followUp: null` (around `:941`, inside
 * `case "PULL_PATIENT"` around `:811`) when it creates an admission, so no action available in the
 * prototype can put a record there. `ward-reanchor.ts` moves the record's `recordedAt` because
 * `INSTANT_FIELDS` NAMES `recordedAt`, explicitly and with its own comment saying a nested instant
 * is exactly the kind that set loses track of — not, as this comment claimed until 2026-09-01, as a
 * side effect of the shift recursing.

/**
 * ⚠️ **THE COUNT MAY NOT COME BACK.** Until 2026-09-01 `community-index.tsx`'s own doc comment said
 * "sixty-five" three times — twice as a count of team pages and once as the honest "0 of 65" the
 * index replaces. Every one of those was a property of the seed, none was a property of the page,
 * and a seed edit would have made all three false with nothing going red anywhere. That is the fifth
 * and sixth member of a class `statistics-derivations.ts` records as having falsified itself
 * silently four times on one paragraph.
 *
 * The rule the rewrite writes to, and the rule these assertions enforce: **describe what the
 * derivation can and cannot establish, never what the seed happens to contain.** A count RENDERED
 * from live state is fine — the referral-join figures on the statistics home page are the pattern.
 * A count TYPED into prose is the defect, and a doc comment cannot render, so the count comes out
 * rather than moving.
 *
 * Scoped to the leading doc comment because that is where the claim lived and where a rewrite would
 * put it back. The rest of the file legitimately contains digits — `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `=== 0`, a `404`
 * — and a whole-file numeral scan would have to carve exceptions for all of them, which is how a
 * guard becomes something people switch off.
