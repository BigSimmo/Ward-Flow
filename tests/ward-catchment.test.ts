/**
 * 🔴 A NOTE A COORDINATOR READS CARRIES NO MARKUP THEY CAN READ.
 *
 * Found in a browser on 2026-09-11, not inferred: the destination picker on the referral intake
 * screen was showing a coordinator literal backticks — *"names `Kwinana` as the approved
 * hospital"*. The intake form (`referral-intake.tsx`, since retired) rendered a catchment note as plain `{expression}` text
 * inside a `<p>`. There is no markdown component and no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere on
 * that path, so punctuation written as markup is never interpreted and reaches the screen exactly
 * as typed.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE REPAIR WAS TO THE CONTENT, AND THE ALTERNATIVE WAS WORSE THAN IT LOOKS.** Rendering
 * notes through something that interprets markdown would not have been the larger version of the
 * same fix — it would CREATE a rendering surface on a clinical screen where none exists, and
 * every note in the application would become one.
 *
 * 🔴 **THE POPULATION IS DERIVED BY REACHABILITY, NOT BY LISTING NOTES — AND THAT IS THE WHOLE
 * DESIGN OF THIS GUARD.**
 *
 * `ward-catchment.ts` holds nineteen `note` strings. **Ten of them reach no screen at all**: they
 * hang off `SUBURB_ALIASES`, which `lookupCatchment` never reads, and they keep their backticks
 * deliberately (see that array's own comment). A guard floored on "every note containing a
 * backtick" would therefore be floored on a population most of whose members CANNOT FAIL — the
 * same inflation defect that makes "12 files scanned, 0 flagged" read as healthier than "2
 * scanned, 0 flagged".
 *
 * So the population here is built by asking `lookupCatchment` itself what it can return. A note is
 * in scope if and only if the exported function can hand it to a caller. **Reachability by
 * construction: an alias note added tomorrow is correctly out of scope, and a note that BECOMES
 * reachable is correctly swept in without anybody editing this file.**
 */
/*
 * ✅ **MUTATION-PROVEN, AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT PROVED NOTHING.**
 *
 * Attempt 1 targeted the note by LINE NUMBER (897), taken from an enumeration run before this
 * file's own comment block was inserted twenty-two lines above it. The line had moved; the edit
 * landed on a blank line; the suite returned 56 passed. ⚠️ **That green was a re-run of the
 * baseline wearing a mutation's name** — and only an assertion that the anchor text was actually
 * present caught it. A line number is a different number in every tree.
 *
 * Attempt 2 anchored on the note's CONTENT and restored one backtick pair into one reachable
 * note:
 *
 *     x the catchment notes a coordinator can reach carry no markup characters
 *
 * ONE of the two content cases red, and the ED note's case stayed green — correct, because the
