 * button can produce: a second acceptance of a movement the first already won. `WardScreen`'s
 * `referralAnswerBlocked` is an exact mirror of every OTHER reducer precondition (see that
 * function's own doc comment), so the button is never rendered enabled for a refusal the reducer
 * would actually raise — except this one, which cannot be seen coming from a single render because
 * it depends on what a second, concurrent accept just did.
 *
 * The trigger dispatches an ordinary, winning `ACCEPT_IN_PRINCIPLE` for the same movement and unit
 * `WardScreen`'s own button is about to try, then clicks that real button SYNCHRONOUSLY, inside the
 * same event handler — never via a second `fireEvent` call, which would let React flush and remove
 * the button from the DOM (accepted, it moves out of "incoming") before the second click could ever
 * land. Because both dispatches happen inside one native click handler, React's automatic batching
 * queues them against the same `useReducer` in order: this one first (accepted), `WardScreen`'s own
 * second (refused, because the movement is already accepted) — so `WardScreen`'s own
 * `priorRejectionCountRef` capture (read synchronously, before ITS dispatch) is still the count
 * from before either action, and the growth its effect sees is correctly attributed to its own
 * click.
