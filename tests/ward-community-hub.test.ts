/**
 * THE COMMUNITY HUB'S DERIVATIONS, after the association rule changed.

 * ⚠️ **THIS FILE REPLACES A REGION-BASED ONE, AND THE REPLACEMENT IS THE SUBJECT.** The previous
 * version asserted `admission.homeRegion === team.region` in a dozen shapes. The owner ruled on
 * 2026-08-31 that association comes from **a team named on the referral** and that home region is a
 * geographic guess, so every one of those assertions pinned the wrong rule. They are not adapted;
 * porting a test whose premise was reversed is how a guard comes to protect the defect.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST HERE IS THE ONE THAT PROVES REGION IS NOT READ.** Everything else
 * could pass on an implementation that consulted region as a tie-break or a fallback, because the
 * fixture's regions and its referral teams would usually agree. So two admissions are built with
 * the SAME home region and DIFFERENT referral teams, and a third with a region matching nothing.
 * Only an implementation that ignores region entirely can satisfy them.
