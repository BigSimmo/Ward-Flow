/**
 * THE COORDINATOR STATISTICS SCREEN, ON THE SCREEN.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHAT ONLY A RENDERED PAGE CAN PROVE, and therefore what this file is for.**
 * `tests/ward-statistics-derivations.test.ts` already proves the arithmetic. Three things survive
 * correct arithmetic and can still make this page lie, and each has its own test below:
 *
 *   1. **A count of nought rendering as though the measurement were unavailable.** "No bed is being
 *      prepared" and "bed preparation cannot be timed" are completely different statements. The
 *      test asserts the numeral is present in the count element AND that the count element is not
 *      the absence element — a page that collapsed both to a dash would pass a prose assertion and
 *      fail this one.
 *   2. **The two audiences merged into one undifferentiated list.** The owner named them
 *      separately. The test asserts two distinct sections exist, that each says whose question it
 *      answers, and that a figure belonging to one is NOT inside the other.
 *   3. **An empty state that says only that data is absent.** The test asserts each absence names
 *      the mechanism — the field, what the record actually holds, and where a fix would have to be
 *      made — rather than merely reading "not yet collected".
 *
 * ⚠️ **EVERY EXPECTED FIGURE IS A LITERAL.** The fixtures below are built from instants chosen so
 * the answer is obvious by inspection (`0` to `120` is two hours), and the assertion types out the
 * rendered string. Nothing here recomputes an expectation with the screen's own derivation, which
 * is the specific defect that made an earlier test in this project unable to fail.

     *      pair can carry a duration" — the same measurement asserted on `referralToBedJoin`
     *      itself rather than on the rendered page. It moves whenever this does, in its own file.
     *   2. The community hub. `admissionBelongsToTeam`
     *      (`src/components/ward-management/community/community-derivations.ts`) runs the same
     *      `find` over the same two arrays, so the one seeded admission that makes these counts
     *      non-nought is also the only thing that can put anybody on one of the 65 team pages.
     *
     * Full account: `docs/ward-flow/fields-with-no-producer-2026-09-01.md` (final addendum).
     *
     * ⚠️ THE SEEDED JOIN MATCHED NINE UNTIL 2026-09-01, AND THIS COMMENT WAS WRONG ABOUT THEM TWICE
     * OVER. It said the nine were an ACCIDENTAL COLLISION between the admissions fixture's ward
     * tags and referrals that happened to share hospital abbreviations, and that the patients
     * arrived WEEKS BEFORE the referral. Neither survives being checked. `52ad01dda` added those
     * nine DELIBERATELY — in its own words, "by using the ids the admissions ALREADY hold, so not
     * one admission changed" — to make the community team pages render; `git log -S'RF-SCGO-15'`
     * returns it, and `fa616d1c9` is where they were removed again, for a third reason: they asked
     * for no ward bed and sat at the top of the coordinator's bed-matching queue. And three of the
     * nine were 1.03, 3.03 and 5.04 days, not weeks. ⚠️ The one-day case is the dangerous one,
     * because it reads as a rounding error rather than as a category error.
     *
     * ⚠️ BOTH HALVES ARE TRUE AND NEITHER ALONE IS THE STORY: the nine were deliberate, and the
     * pairs they produced were meaningless. Every one put the patient in the bed before the
     * referral existed, so not one could carry a duration.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE COUNT IS ONE NOW, AND THAT IS THE FRONT DOOR STARTING TO WORK RATHER THAN THE
     * COLLISION RETURNING. `AD-LEFT-01` names `RF-010`, the community-only referral split out of
     * `RF-007`; the referral is raised 24 days before the anchor and the admission arrived 23 days
     * ago, so MATCHED and COHERENT are both one. The equality is the check that matters — a matched
     * count running ahead of the coherent one is the `52ad01dda` shape returning under a new name.
     *
     * ⚠️ **TEN SINCE 2026-09-05, AND THE NINE ADDED ARE DEMONSTRATION DATA — see
     * `MIDLAND_DEMONSTRATION_ROWS` (`ward-movements.ts`).** The owner asked for one community
     * team's page to be populated so the redesign could be judged on a screen with people on it,
     * and nine referrals naming `"Midland"` were added using ids the admissions seed ALREADY
     * manufactures. **Not one admission changed.**
     *
     * ⚠️ **THE TWO FIGURES BELOW MOVED TOGETHER, WHICH IS THE WHOLE TEST.** Every one of the nine
     * is raised, and answered, before its admission's bed was pulled — so each match can date a
     * bed, and MATCHED still equals COHERENT. **A ten that is not matched by a ten below is the
