/**
 * AN EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT REFERRAL SAYS WHICH DEPARTMENT, AND WHY.
 *
 * `FD-15`/`FD-11`, decided and unbuilt until now. Three different flows all address an emergency
 * department and none of them means the same thing:
 *
 *   community → ED           purpose "bed"
 *   ED psychiatry → itself   purpose "psychiatric_review"   (`FD-16`: the self-addressed inbox)
 *   ward → ED                purpose "medical_assessment"
 *
 * ⚠️ **PURPOSE IS A SEPARATE AXIS AND MUST NOT BE FOLDED INTO `kind`.** A fourth destination kind
 * encoding "psychiatry review at an ED" would put the WHY inside the WHERE, and then a bed request
 * and a review request are answered by the same affordance — which is how one becomes the other by
 * accident. Three kinds, three purposes, orthogonal.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND THE WORKAROUND THIS EXISTS TO KILL, WHICH WAS FOUND AND REFUSED RATHER THAN SHIPPED:**
 * inferring "addressed to itself" from `originSiteCode === department.siteCode`. That compiles,
 * reads correctly, and puts the ward→ED MEDICAL notification straight into the psychiatry inbox —
 * because a psychiatric ward at the same hospital shares that site code. It is wrong on exactly the
 * case the spec names, which is the case nobody re-reads after implementing from it. `FD-18` is the
 * general form. The last test in this file is the guard.
 */
/**
 * Typed as the NARROWED arm rather than the `ReferralDestination` union, deliberately. Returning
 * the union compiles and then hides the fields this file exists to check: `.edId` is not reachable
 * on a union member without narrowing, so every assertion about it would need a cast — and a cast
 * is exactly what would let the field be removed again without this file noticing.
