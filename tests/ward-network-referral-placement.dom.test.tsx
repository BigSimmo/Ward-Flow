 *  - **Reachable.** Secondary must mean "the other picture", never "the picture you can no longer
 *    get back to".
 *  - **Routing decorates it and does not arrange it.** Line weight is roadmap 14's own commitment and
 *    it survives here, subordinate: the connector lines say which units the selected movement is
 *    shortlisted for, and they must never become an ordering of the picture. An overview that put the
 *    routed wards first would be a ranking nobody decided to build.
 *  - **One clock.** The time control is roadmap 14's too, it lives in the ward shell's own sidebar,
 *    and it drives the shared `now` through the reducer. A second clock here would let two screens
 *    disagree about the same moment silently, and one eligibility gate is time-dependent.
