/**
 * 🔴 **A COUNT OF ONE IS THE ONLY VALUE THAT CAN BREAK A SENTENCE, AND NO FIXTURE PRODUCED IT.**
 *
 * Found on 2026-09-06 on a live page: *"1 of the 4 above are flagged urgent."* The count was right.
 * The seed simply never handed these screens a one while anybody was looking, and nought and two
 * both read correctly, so every screenshot and every existing test agreed the sentence was fine.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE ESTATE ALREADY DOES THIS EVERYWHERE ELSE, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS A DEFECT AND NOT A
 * STYLE.** `ward-board.tsx`, `ed-home.tsx`, `out-of-area-board.tsx`, `patient-typeahead.tsx`,
 * `delays-screen.tsx` and `community-index.tsx` all switch the noun or the verb on the count — and
 * so does `statistics-screen.tsx`, the statistics HOME page, meticulously, in all seven of its
 * count sentences. The per-ward and per-department pages were the two files in that family that
 * did not, so they read as a lapse against their own neighbours rather than as a decision.
 *
 * **THE FIXTURE IS THE ARGUMENT: exactly one of everything.** One admission, carrying every state
 * this screen counts at once, so a single render exercises every count sentence at the one value
 * that can break it. A test parameterised over 0, 1 and 2 would pass at two-thirds strength and
 * report a hit rate rather than a defect.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS GUARDS A RENDERING, DELIBERATELY, AND THAT IS NOT THE USUAL RULE.** Ward Lead's
 * standing instruction is to guard the claim and never the rendering — because a wording pin goes
 * green on a rephrasing that leaves the defect in place. Number agreement is the exception that
 * proves it: the defect IS in the rendering, the claim underneath was correct the whole time, and
 * there is nothing else to assert. So this checks agreement and nothing else. It says nothing about
 * which words are used, only that a one is not followed by a plural.

 * admission timed against a `NOW` of the test's own choosing lands in the FUTURE and is skipped by
 * every derivation that compares against the clock. My first version did exactly that: it looked
 * like one admission of every kind and rendered "0.5 days" and "None. No admission on this ward has
 * passed three months." Two of the five measures were not being exercised at all.
