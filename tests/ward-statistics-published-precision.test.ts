/**
 * EVERY PUBLISHED AVERAGE CARRIES ONLY THE PRECISION IT CLAIMS.
 *
 * 🔴 THE DEFECT, FOUND BY OPENING THE PAGE ON 2026-09-06. Every ward statistics page published
 * `average length of stay 44.33680555555556 days` — fourteen decimal places of apparent precision
 * on a clinical figure derived from invented data, on a prototype about to be published. One figure
 * had three treatments: the field's own comment said "whole days", nothing rounded, the compare
 * screen applied `.toFixed(1)`, and the per-ward screen rendered it raw.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NO TEST SAW IT AND THE EXISTING ONES WERE NOT WRONG.** `ward-statistics-ward-nulls.dom.test.tsx`
 * asks whether a null is ever shown as a zero — the right question, and it passes. `ward-statistics.test.ts`
 * asks whether the arithmetic is right — also right, and it passes, because **the arithmetic WAS
 * right.** Precision is a third question and nothing asked it.
 *
 * 🔴 **THE FIXTURE IS CHOSEN SO IT CANNOT DIVIDE EVENLY, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE FIRST
 * ASSERTION IN EACH TEST.** The sibling figure `averageEmptyBedMinutes` looked untouched by this
 * defect and was not: it rendered a tidy "300 minutes" purely because the seed happened to divide,
 * with nothing rounding it either. **A fixture that divides evenly makes this whole file pass over
 * nothing** — so each test first proves its own input is a real test case by asserting the
 * UNROUNDED value has more precision than the published one, and only then checks the published
 * value. Swap in a tidy fixture and the anti-vacuity assertion fails by name.
