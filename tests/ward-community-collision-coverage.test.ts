/**
 * WHAT THE SHARED NEAR-DUPLICATE DERIVATION ACTUALLY CATCHES — asserted over the real team list.
 *
 * This is deliberately a test ABOUT THE DERIVATION rather than about any screen. Two surfaces now
 * lean on `communityNameCollisions()` — the gateway and each team's own page — and the whole point
 * of Ward Lead's one-derivation ruling is that neither screen carries its own copy. A property
 * proved here is proved for both; a property proved on one screen is proved for one screen.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL: A FIX BROKE A CASE IT WAS NOT ABOUT, AND NO COUNT MOVED.**
 * On 2026-09-05 the gateway prototype's own copy of this rule gained "clinic" and "centre" in its
 * list of stripped service words — a correct fix for `Inner City Clinic` sitting unflagged beside
 * `Inner City`. That shortened every key containing one of those words, and
 * `Meade Centre (Armadale)` and `Mead Centre (Armadale)` became the four-character keys "meade"
 * and "mead", which the length gate then refused to compare at all. **The misspelling the feature
 * exists to catch fell out of its own group as a side effect of an unrelated correction.** The
 * group count was 13 before and 13 after. Only re-reading the NAMES showed it.
 *
 * So the assertions below are about NAMED PAIRS, never about how many groups there are. A count
 * cannot fail this way, which is exactly why a count must not be the guard.
 */
/**
 * 🔴 READ THIS FIRST IF THIS FILE HAS JUST GONE RED. IT IS PROBABLY DOING ITS JOB.
 *
 * The owner is replacing the community team data wholesale (told to Ward Builder One, 2026-09-05).
 * **When that lands, most of the assertions below SHOULD fail**, because every one of them pins a
 * NAMED PAIR out of the current list: `Wheat Belt` / `Wheatbelt HS`, the four-way Mead family,
 * `Gascoyne`'s three, `Midalnd` / `Midland`, and the ICC absence. Those names may simply not exist
 * in the new data.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE RIGHT RESPONSE IS TO RE-DERIVE, NEVER TO MAKE GREEN.** Concretely, and in this order:
 *
 *   1. Read the NEW list and find, by eye, the pairs a human can see are the same service written
 *      twice — a transposition, a misspelling, a spacing difference, a service word dropped.
 *   2. Pin those, by name, in both directions.
 *   3. ⚠️ **NEVER paste the output of `communityNameCollisions()` in as the expected value.** That
 *      recreates the exact tautology this file exists to replace: a baseline taken from the subject
 *      cannot disagree with it, so the test passes for any predicate, including a broken one.
 *      `RECORDED_COLLISIONS` in `ward-community-vocabulary.test.ts` carries the same warning and the
 *      same requirement to be re-derived BY HAND.
 *
 * ⚠️ **AND DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE AS REDUNDANT, WHICH IS THE OBVIOUS TIDY-UP.** It overlaps with
 * the near-duplicate guard on the team pages, and that overlap is the only coverage the predicate
 * has. Measured by Ward Builder One on 2026-09-05, on their own guard, and written into the top of
 * their file at `31514fdfa`: truncating `communityNameCollisions()` to five families drops five
 * real ones — `Midland`/`Midalnd` among them — and **every assertion in their biconditional stays
 * green.** It proves the page agrees with the predicate and nothing about whether the predicate is
 * right.
 *
 * **Both of the real bugs found on 2026-09-05 were found by a SECOND implementation disagreeing
 * with the first, name by name — never by a count.** Two counts agreeing would have found neither.
 * When the new data lands, run an independent implementation over it and take the symmetric
 * difference BY NAME; that comparison is what found the whitespace gap leaving `Wheat Belt`
 * unflagged, and the missing service words leaving `Inner City Clinic` unflagged.

   * ⚠️ **THE FIXTURE NO LONGER HOLDS ONE, AND THAT IS A FIX RATHER THAN A LOSS** — 2026-09-06,

   * IT WAS WRITTEN AS AN HONEST MISS: `ICC` and `Inner City Clinic` are plainly one service to a
   * human, no spelling rule reaches an initialism, and both screens cited ICC in words as the live
   * proof that an unmarked name is no guarantee. The pin existed so that teaching the rule about

   * City` (16 suburbs), `ICC` (3), `Inner City Clinic` (1), `Inner City (central)` (1), 21 suburbs
   * — and an owner-confirmed alias table records it. So the "miss" is closed as a FACT while
   * remaining open as a COMPUTATION, and that gap is deliberate: the alias table is unreachable
   * from the similarity relation on purpose, so a human decision can never be mistaken for a rule's
   * guess. **A reader must be able to tell "a person decided these are one service" from "these
   * strings look alike", and folding the table into the relation erases exactly that.**
   *
   * SO WHAT THIS NOW PINS is that separation: the similarity rule has NOT absorbed the human
   * decision. If this goes red, somebody has wired the alias table into `communityNameCollisions()`
   * and the two authorities have been merged into one — which is the thing the ruling exists to
   * prevent, not a limitation to celebrate closing.
   *

   * way; it always did. The prototypes that cited ICC as an uncaught name were corrected by hand
