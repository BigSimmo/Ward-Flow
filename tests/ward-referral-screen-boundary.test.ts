/**
 * FD-23 AT THE SCREEN BOUNDARY — a ward-facing surface may reach referral data only through the
 * ward-scoped projection.
 *
 * **Owner ruling, 2026-08-30: a ward cannot see where else a patient has been referred. The
 * coordinator may see everything.** His reason: so a ward does not spend its time on a patient who
 * is being placed elsewhere. Spec Part 7 (`docs/ward-flow-referral-destination-spec.md`).
 *
 * `src/components/ward-management/ward-referral-visibility.ts` already holds that rule in the DATA:
 * `WardScopedReferral` has no `destinations` field, `CoordinatorScopedReferral` does, and
 * `tests/ward-referral-visibility.test.ts` guards both at every level. **Nothing stopped a
 * ward-facing component importing the full `Referral` and bypassing the projection entirely.** A
 * guard that holds at the model and not at the screen is the guard the next person building a ward
 * screen walks around in good faith, because the full type is right there and imports fine.
 *
 * This file closes that. Three decisions are made below, and each is written down rather than
 * implied, because every one of them is a place this guard could be quietly narrowed later.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 1. WHICH COMPONENTS ARE WARD-FACING — `WARD_FACING`, enumerated, never a path pattern
 *
 * A pattern (`ward/**`, `*ward*`) silently acquires new files and silently misses renamed ones,
 * and a guard whose scope moves on its own is a guard nobody can reason about. So the list is
 * literal, its length is pinned, and every entry carries the sentence that put it there:
 *
 * - **`ward/ward-screen.tsx`** — route `/mockups/ward-flow/ward/[unitId]`. It says what it is on
 *   itself: "This is {unit.name}'s own view. Every figure and referral below belongs to this ward
 *   — never another one." That sentence IS the FD-23 rule, rendered.
 * - **`board/ward-board.tsx`** — route `/mockups/ward-flow/board/[unitId]`, "one ward's beds on a
 *   screen". Scoped to a single unit and read by that unit's staff.
 * - **`board/ward-daily-sheet.tsx`** — the printed sheet the ward board renders, "the page a charge
 *   nurse carries into the morning meeting". It has no route of its own and is reached only through
 *   the board, but it is listed as an entry point in its own right because it is the surface that
 *   goes on PAPER: a leak here leaves the building.
 * - **`community/community-team-hub.tsx`** — added 2026-09-04, the day this list went stale within
 *   hours of a plan being written against it. Owner ruling the same day: community becomes its own
 *   first-class role, alongside ED, coordinator and the wards, and a community team may NOT see
 *   that a patient was referred anywhere else — the identical restriction FD-23 already gives a
 *   ward. `CommunityScopedReferral` (`ward-referral-visibility.ts`, `66b10a439`) is the projection
 *   this component must read; `tests/ward-community-viewer-assumption.test.ts` pins that
 *   projection's own shape. It is the community role's OWN landing for one team and is a different
 *   screen from the coordinator's drill-down into the same team (`community/community-home.tsx`,
 *   in `SEES_EVERYTHING` below) even though the two can render the same team at the same moment —
 *   see the build plan's Task 3b on why that visual resemblance is exactly the reason the two must
 *   never share a component or a data type, and why a shared component would fall OUTSIDE this very
 *   guarded set by construction (section 2 below).
 *
 * **Considered and deliberately NOT ward-facing**, so the reasoning is recoverable rather than
 * inferred from an absence: `wards/ward-index.tsx` is the statewide index of every ward, not one
 * ward's own view; `handover/handover-page.tsx`, `escalation/escalation-board.tsx`,
 * `discharges/discharge-board.tsx`, `out-of-area/out-of-area-board.tsx`, `search/patient-search.tsx`
 * and `tracker/live-tracker.tsx` are network-wide coordinator boards; `movements/[movementId]`
 * renders `WardPatientWorkspace` from the coordinator console. Every one of them appears in
 * `SEES_EVERYTHING` below. `morning/morning-page.tsx` and its tour left that list on 2026-09-17
 * (item 41, owner-approved): the screen itself was deleted outright, not merely redirected, so it
 * no longer needs an exemption from a guard it cannot reach.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 2. WHAT "REACHING REFERRAL DATA" MEANS — three vectors, two checks
 *
 * (a) **Naming the full record.** Importing `Referral`, `ReferralAddressing`, `referralState` or
 *     the coordinator projection — the vocabulary that carries, or derives a fact from, ALL of a
 *     referral's destinations. `FULL_REFERRAL_VOCABULARY` enumerates the spellings EXACTLY rather
 *     than using a `Referral\w*` wildcard, because `ReferralSource`, `ReferralDeclineReason` and
 *     `UrgencyLevel` are person/answer facts that `WardScopedReferral` itself carries and a ward is
 *     entitled to. A wildcard would forbid the projection's own field types.
 *
 * (b) **Reaching it through an intermediate module.** A ward component importing
 *     `./referral-cards` which itself imports `Referral` is the same leak with one more file in
 *     front of it, and a direct-import-only check passes forever against it. So the check runs over
 *     the TRANSITIVE local import graph, following `@/…` and `./…` specifiers, exactly as
 *     `tests/ward-referral-matching.test.ts` does for the D15 bed-release contract — the precedent
 *     in this repo, and the one whose own comments record what a weaker version of it missed.
 *     The original graph walk, `scanSource` and its comment-scanner tests came from there:
 *     by that file's own account, its earlier extractor was found passing
 *     33 of 33 with a genuine bed-release import sitting in the graph, one level up.
 *     NEW-QA-001 now shares an AST graph walk that also follows literal dynamic/import-type edges
 *     and refuses computed dynamic paths. The existing vocabulary/comment contracts stay intact.
 *
 * (c) **Receiving it through props or context.** No import graph can see this one:
 *     `useWardFlow()` hands every consumer the full `referrals: Referral[]`, because the
 *     coordinator screens legitimately need it. So a second, separate check reads the
 *     `useWardFlow()` destructuring of each ward-facing entry and fails if `referrals` is in it.
 *     Without this, the whole file would be a guard with its own front door open.
 *
 * **THE GRAPH IS THE WARD-ONLY SUBGRAPH, and this is the load-bearing scoping decision.** Following
 * every import from a React component reaches 53 files, including `ward-flow-provider.tsx` and
 * `ward-model.ts` — shared infrastructure that MUST name `Referral`, since the coordinator's own
 * screens are built from it. A guard asserting "nothing in that graph names a referral" is red on
 * day one and would be neutered into meaninglessness by whoever had to make it pass.
 *
 * So the guarded set is computed, never listed: **every module reachable from the ward-facing
 * entries that NO surface in `SEES_EVERYTHING` reaches.** A module both roles reach is shared
 * infrastructure by construction; a module only ward screens reach is the ward's own code, which is
 * exactly where a helpful person puts a referral helper. The set is six files today and the four
 * that matter are pinned by name below, so a refactor that moves a ward module under a coordinator
 * import — genuinely narrowing this guard — fails here rather than nowhere.
 *
 * **Named limit:** a leak placed in a module a coordinator screen also imports sits outside this
 * set. That is a real hole and it is stated rather than papered over — but it costs the leaker an
 * edit to a coordinator surface as well, which is no longer the good-faith mistake this file
 * exists to catch.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 3. THE COORDINATOR IS EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE — `SEES_EVERYTHING`
 *
 * "The coordinator may see everything" is half the owner's sentence, so the coordinator's surfaces
 * are named as ALLOWED rather than merely omitted, each with the reason beside it. The list is also
 * what the subtraction above runs on, so it is load-bearing twice: it documents the exemption AND
 * defines the boundary. The emergency-department and transport-officer screens sit in it too, on
 * the narrower ground that the ruling names the ward only — `ward-referral-visibility.ts`'s own doc
 * comment declines to decide the ED case, calling it a product decision rather than an
 * implementer's, and this file does not decide it either.
