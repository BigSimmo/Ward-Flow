/**
 * THE CHANGE-AUDIT PANEL MUST NAME EVERY KIND OF CHANGE IT CAN SHOW.
 *
 * 🔴 THE DEFECT. Both of its sentences listed four kinds while `auditKindLabels` held six.
 * `stage_corrected` and `acceptance_withdrawn` were added on 2026-09-04; the heading and the empty
 * state were not touched. **The empty state could therefore say "None — no ... has been recorded
 * yet" on a movement whose stage HAD been corrected** — a false statement of fact about a patient's
 * record, not merely an undercounted summary.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY IT HAPPENED, AND IT IS THE GENERAL MECHANISM. `auditKindLabels` is a TOTAL `Record` over
 * the union, so the compiler forced whoever added the two kinds to add their labels. Nothing forced
 * the paragraph three hundred lines below it. **The compiler is inside the definition of "the code"
 * and the rendered sentence is not**, which is why a codebase this heavily guarded keeps producing
 * this class: the guards are all on the side the compiler can see.
 *
 * ⚠️ SO THE REPAIR DERIVED THE SENTENCE FROM THE MAP, AND THIS FILE GUARDS THE DERIVATION RATHER
 * THAN THE WORDS. A test pinning the new sentence would go green the moment somebody rephrased it
 * and red the moment somebody improved it, and — worse — would say nothing at all if a seventh kind
 * were added. This walks the map, so a new kind that does not reach the screen fails here.
