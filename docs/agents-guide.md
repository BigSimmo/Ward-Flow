# Agents Guide

Short onboarding pointer. The authoritative, always-current rules for agents
working in this repository live in the root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) —
verification gates, provider confirmation boundaries, Supabase project safety,
review routing, and workflow shortcuts. This page only orients you; it does not
duplicate those rules, so it cannot drift from them.

## Read in this order

1. [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — agent rules, verification gates, shortcuts
   (`upload`, `dependency`, `bug-hunter`), and safety boundaries. It is a small
   always-loaded core plus an index; the full text of most rules lives in a named
   file under [`docs/agents/`](agents/), which the core points to by path.
2. [`docs/codebase-index.md`](codebase-index.md) — architecture and module map.
3. [`docs/README.md`](README.md) — index of all runbooks, governance docs, and
   plans, with maintained vs historical classification.
4. [`docs/site-map.md`](site-map.md) — generated route map.

## Human quickstart

- Node 24.x / npm 11.x are hard requirements (`engine-strict`); the app is
  Next.js 16 + Supabase + OpenAI.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in values (never commit
  secrets). Without Supabase/OpenAI values the app runs in demo mode on a
  synthetic corpus.
- `npm run ensure` starts or verifies the dev server on a stable
  project-specific port (never assume `localhost:3000`).
- `npm run worker` runs the local ingestion worker in a second terminal.
- When adding environment variables, update the schema in `src/lib/env.ts` and
  document them in `.env.example`.
- Before handing off changes: `npm run verify:cheap` first, then
  `npm run verify:pr-local` when the change is PR-ready (see
  [`docs/process-hardening.md`](process-hardening.md) for the full
  verification pyramid).

## AI tooling map

This repo intentionally uses several AI systems; the overlap is by design, not
accident. [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) is the single source of truth — every system
below defers to it, so rules live in one place and cannot drift.

| System                    | Owns                                                       | Where it is configured                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Rule of thumb: change agent behaviour in `AGENTS.md` — or in the `docs/agents/` file its core
points to for that rule — then let each system inherit it. A rule has exactly one home; do not
answer a drift report by adding a second copy somewhere more convenient.
Do not add a new AI system or grow the skill count without retiring something — the
breadth is already a maintenance cost for a single maintainer. Prefer **≤5 active MCP
servers** per session (tool-schema token bloat degrades agents).

## MCP default read path (ops / docs)

Use registered MCPs before opening dashboards when the task is read-only inspection.
Writes, secret rotations, and hosted mutations stay confirmation-gated per `AGENTS.md`.

### Context7 API key (optional)

1. Create a free key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) (`ctx7sk…`).
2. **Project MCP (checked-in):** `.cursor/mcp.json` runs pinned local
   `@upstash/context7-mcp@3.2.5` with `env.CONTEXT7_API_KEY: ${env:CONTEXT7_API_KEY}` so the
   stdio child receives the key when Cursor expands it (Cursor filters inherited env for MCP
   children — the explicit `env` pass-through is required). Set the key as a **user/OS env var**
   or in Cursor **Settings → MCP → context7**.
3. **Cursor Cloud Agent Secrets:** inject `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` into the agent shell
   `process.env`. That authenticates **local** Context7 (`npx @upstash/context7-mcp` /
   `npx ctx7`) and project stdio MCP after reload. It does **not** authenticate a separate
   **host-injected** Context7 connector — measured 2026-08-05: host `resolve-library-id`
   still returned monthly quota exceeded while the same key worked for `npx ctx7 library …`.
   If host MCP is quota-blocked, use `npx ctx7 library|docs …` (or the project local MCP
   after reload) — do not invent APIs from training data.
4. **Does not expand project MCP `${env:}`:** `.env.local` alone (Next app / env.ts path).
5. **Reload MCP servers after key changes.** The stdio child captures env at spawn time — setting
   or rotating `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` has no effect until you reload MCP (or restart Cursor).
6. **Keyless / lower rate limits:** when `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` is unset, Cursor expands
   `${env:CONTEXT7_API_KEY}` to an empty string and the server runs anonymously. If MCP logs
   ever show the literal placeholder `${env:CONTEXT7_API_KEY}` as the key value, remove the
   `env` object from the `context7` entry (anonymous) or set a real key, then reload MCP.
7. Prefer `resolve-library-id` → `query-docs` when the authenticated MCP path is available;
   otherwise `npx ctx7`. Avoid raw `curl` with keys in chat logs unless debugging.

Never paste credential values into chat, issues, or commits. Prefer presence/length checks
(`check:local-presence`) over dumping env contents.

## Auto-fixer governance and deduplication (#JZM7RM)

To prevent dual competing responders from answering the same PR review comment (observed on PR #2249 where both a repo workflow and an app-level watcher generated duplicate competing commits):

1. **Authoritative responder**: The repository GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/codex-autofix-review-comments.yml`) is the primary automated resolver for Codex PR review comments. It includes explicit governance safeguards:
   - Trusted-bot login gating (`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`).
   - Per-PR deduplication marker (`<!-- codex-autoresolve-pr:<number> -->`).
   - Single automatic repair pass per PR lifetime to prevent runaway repair loops.
   - Respect for `skip-codex-review` labels and explicit opt-ins via `codex-review`.
   - Hard hold: clinical-decision surfaces (`data/**`, `src/data/**`, `src/lib/mha-act-sections.ts`, `src/lib/form-catalog.ts`, `src/lib/form-ranker.ts`, `src/components/forms/**`, `src/lib/rag/**`, and named ranking surfaces) are never automatically repaired.
2. **Bot ownership boundaries and watcher throttling**:
   - **Repository Codex auto-fixer**: Owns unattended repair of actionable Codex review comments on open PRs passing risk routing.
   - **App-level / Client watchers**: Interactive desktop or client app watchers ("Autofix pull requests") must stand down and not compete on repository pull requests. Do not instruct an interactive agent session to concurrently fix a review comment that is already queued or being addressed by the repository workflow.
   - **CodeRabbit**: Advisory only (`commit_status: false`), intermittent/capped, skipped on draft PRs. Never generates fix commits or competes for PR mutation.
   - **Interactive human / agent sessions**: When asked to fix comments or running a `Run PR` sweep, always check if an auto-fixer has already replied or pushed fixes (`<!-- codex-thread-disposition:resolved -->`). Never create competing commits on the same review finding.
3. **Review comment lifecycle and disposition markers**:
   - For every fixed or fully dispositioned thread, start the thread reply with `<!-- codex-thread-disposition:resolved -->`.
   - On the next line, include `<!-- codex-thread-result:fixed-head:<40-character commit SHA> -->` for code fixes or `<!-- codex-thread-result:no-change -->` for no-code dispositions.
   - Threads requiring human judgment, architectural decisions, or touching clinical holds must be left open with an explanatory reply instead of using the resolved marker.
