# The PsychSift logo

The files in `public/brand/` are the master artwork. They are true vectors — every curve is a
circular arc with an exact centre and radius, so the mark is identical at 16 px and at billboard
size, and the primary file is 863 bytes.

This page records **how the mark is built**, so it can be rebuilt or extended without guessing.

## What the mark is

A rounded navy tile carrying an **S** made of two counter-turning strokes, with a single white
point settled to the upper right.

The S is the initial of _Sift_ and reads as two halves of one judgement. The point is what has been
sifted out and come to rest.

An earlier version of these files carried two small blue points falling below the white one. They
have been removed at the owner's direction, and the mark is now a single colour on its tile.

## Provenance

The mark was drawn from the original PsychSift brand sheet. The mark on that sheet is the
authoritative design; the large blue raster that circulated alongside it is a low-fidelity
enlargement and must not be used.

The geometry here was measured from a high-resolution view of the original, arc by arc, at the
**50% level of its anti-aliased edges** — the one place on a blurred edge that is not biased by the
blur. Each arc was then fitted on its own, so its residual could be inspected rather than hidden in
an aggregate: per-arc RMS runs from 0.05 to 0.14 units in 100. Outside the middle the mark covers 94% of
the original by area (intersection over union); the middle departs from the original on purpose.

Three earlier drafts got this wrong in instructive ways, and every error came from trusting a
measurement that the source could not actually support.

**The terminals are sharp.** At the size the original was first sampled, a sharp point blurs into a
rounded blob. The first draft fitted that blur and gave the mark rounded club-ends. Both tips are
genuine cusps: the outer edge runs into the inner edge and the crossing is the point.

**The tail leaves the main sweep.** The second draft modelled each stroke as four arcs, with the
whole outer edge on one circle. It is not: below about two-thirds of the way down, the outer edge
peels away from that circle and hooks further out — by three full units at the very tip. That hook
is what draws the tail into a long fine point, and without it the tail stops short and the stroke
reads heavy. Fitting by nearest-point distance had hidden this, because every point on a slightly
wrong outline still sits close to _some_ point of the right one. Comparing coverage against the
original's grey levels showed it immediately.

**The middle line is one straight cut.** Two drafts got this wrong in the same way. The first drew
each stroke's facing edge from its own circle, curving opposite ways; two arcs bowing apart open a
lens, and the gap swelled from 5.4 units at its ends to 8.6 in the middle. The second made both
edges arcs of a single circle, which fixed the width but left each stroke reaching its edge through
a tight 7.5-unit blend that reads as a knuckle on the spine of the S.

The mark now does the simplest thing instead: the two strokes are divided by **one straight line**,
and each stroke's facing edge is that line offset by half the gap. The two edges are therefore
exactly parallel — the gap is one width down its whole length, and neither edge can curve against
the other. Each stroke joins its edge with a single 13-unit blend under the head, and both blends
bend the same way, away from the other stroke. Nothing on either facing edge turns over.

This is a deliberate improvement on the original rather than a copy of it. The original's channel
is 4.75 units wide with a standard deviation of 0.25 and bows by 1.25 units along its length; this
one is 4.35 with a standard deviation of 0.28 and does not bow at all.

Two things were corrected, and one apparent oddity was kept.

**Corrected.** The glyph is centred in its tile; the original sat hard against the right edge. And
every junction between arcs is tangent-continuous, so enlarging the mark reveals no kink.

**Kept.** The second stroke's outer silhouette is drawn **7% larger** than the first's. Forcing the
two to be identical measurably worsens the match and opens up the channel between them, which is the
tension the mark depends on. A further 3.5° rotation improves the fit by another half a percent; it
was left out deliberately, because an arbitrary tilt is not something a logo specification should
carry.

## Construction

Work in **glyph units**: the S is exactly 100 units tall and 55.10 wide, with its top-left corner
at the origin.

### The middle line

The two strokes are divided by **one straight line**:

|                            |                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| A point on it              | (26.2380, 48.6900)             |
| Unit normal                | (0.87626, 0.48184)             |
| Direction                  | 118.806°                       |
| Upper stroke's facing edge | the line at normal·x = 44.6629 |
| Lower stroke's facing edge | the line at normal·x = 48.8629 |

The two edges are the same line offset ±2.1 units, so they are exactly parallel: the gap is
**4.2 units wide down its whole length** and neither edge curves against the other. Everything else
in the mark is built to meet those two lines tangentially.

The cut sits where it does for a reason: at normal·x = 44.6629 the point reflection that makes the
second stroke carries the **upper stroke's facing edge exactly onto the lower one**. The whole mark
is therefore invariant under that single transform, and the second stroke can be — and is — written
as a transform of the first rather than as its own path. If the gap changes, this position has to be
re-solved from `(normal·origin − gap) / 2.07`; it is not a free number.

This is the part to protect. Give the two facing edges separate curves and the gap opens into a
lens; that is what the first two cuts of these files did.

### The upper stroke

Three arcs and one straight segment, meeting at two tangent points and two sharp cusps:

| Segment     | Centre             | Radius   | Role                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Outer sweep | (29.2009, 29.2009) | 29.2009  | the outer edge, from the head to two-thirds down |
| Tail hook   | (51.5937, 16.1418) | 55.1234  | the hook that draws the tail to a point          |
| Throat      | (44.8724, 20.0286) | 17.7232  | the scoop under the head                         |
| Blend       | (17.3065, 33.5945) | 13.0     | carries the throat onto the cut                  |
| Facing edge | —                  | straight | the upper side of the middle line                |

- **Head cusp** at (41.3675, 2.6554) — outer sweep into throat, 36°.
- **Tail cusp** at (18.0434, 59.8793) — the cut into the tail hook, 81°.
- **Tangent points** at (3.9761, 43.9116) outer sweep into tail hook, (29.0679, 28.0493) throat into
  blend, and (28.8667, 40.1963) blend onto the cut.

The outer sweep is centred at (r, r) for its own radius, so it is tangent to both the top and the
left edge of the stroke's bounding box. That relationship fell out of the fit rather than being
imposed, and it is the quickest way to check a redraw.

### The lower stroke

The outer silhouette is the upper stroke's, point-reflected and enlarged 7%:

```
translate(55.1029 100.3813) scale(-1.07)
```

A negative uniform scale is a 180° rotation and a 7% enlargement in one step. That gives:

| Segment     | Centre             | Radius   | Role                              |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Outer sweep | (23.8579, 69.1363) | 31.2450  | the outer edge                    |
| Tail hook   | (−0.1024, 83.1096) | 58.9820  | the hook into the tail            |
| Throat      | (7.0894, 78.9507)  | 18.9638  | the scoop under the head          |
| Blend       | (36.4044, 64.0737) | 13.9100  | carries the throat onto the cut   |
| Facing edge | —                  | straight | the lower side of the middle line |

- **Head cusp** at (10.8397, 97.5400) — outer sweep into throat, 36°.
- **Tail cusp** at (35.7966, 36.3105) — the cut into the tail hook, 81°.
- **Tangent points** at (50.8485, 53.3959) outer sweep into tail hook, (24.0003, 70.3687) throat
  into blend, and (24.2156, 57.3713) blend onto the cut.

Every one of those numbers is the point reflection of the upper stroke's, including the facing edge
and the blend, so the second stroke is written in the files as

```
<path d="…the upper stroke…" transform="translate(55.1029 100.3813) scale(-1.07)"/>
```

and the table above is a convenience, not a second source of truth. Keeping that exact — rather than
approximately — true is what fixes the cut's position; see **The middle line** above.

### The point

A circle of radius **10.4586** centred at **(44.8724, 20.0286)** — which is exactly the centre of
the throat arc.

That is the whole of the placement rule. Because the point shares its centre with the arc that cups
it, the crescent of white between them is a **constant 7.2646 units** all the way round — 17.7232
less the point's own 10.4586 — with zero variation. It is the same idea as the straight cut between
the two strokes: negative space of one measured width, not a gap that happens to look about right.
Move the point off that centre and the crescent immediately starts to taper. Its clearance to the
lower stroke is 8.18 units.

**The small-size point** sits 10 units further out, at **(54.8724, 20.0286)**, opening the crescent
from 7.26 to 11.55. It travels with the widened cut as a set — the wider ink box it produces also
needs its own centring transform, and mixing one variant's point with the other's placement puts
the glyph off-centre in the tile. Below about 20 px the crescent is under two pixels and the point
fuses into the S whatever is done; that is the size, not the placement.

Two earlier positions are worth recording, because both were wrong in instructive ways. It sat at
(60.4716, 17.3581) until 2026-08-28, well clear of the S to the upper right. The nearest point on
the entire S was the upper stroke's sharp tip, aimed straight at the circle from 13.65 units — 2.2
px at a 16 px icon, which antialiasing closes. A sharp point aimed at a circle reads as contact
even when the numbers say otherwise. Dropping it 7 units to (60.4716, 24.3581) fixed the contact
reading and opened the approach to 18.46 units, but left it floating: too far out, and unrelated to
any curve in the mark. Cradling it in the throat resolves both, and gives the mark a hint of the
**P** in PsychSift alongside the S.

An earlier draft of these files had it at (58.9234, 16.5279) with radius 10.2165. That was a
measurement error, not a decision: 1.8 units in and 2.3% small, which crowded the S's shoulder and
made the point look like a stray rather than a counterweight.

With the point included, the glyph spans 0 to 55.33 horizontally and 0 to 100.38 vertically.
The small-size variant, whose point sits further out, spans 0 to 65.33 by the same 0 to 100.38.

### The tile

A square with a corner radius of **3/16 of its side** (18.75%). The glyph is scaled to **80% of the
tile height** and its ink bounding box — S and point together — is centred in the tile. At 512 px
that leaves 143 px clear on the left and right and 51 px top and bottom.

An earlier draft weighted the placement 46% of the way from the S's own centre toward the glyph's
right edge, on the theory that the light point should not drag the heavy S leftward. It
over-corrected badly: the mark sat 65 px from the left edge and 164 px from the right. Centring the
bounding box is both simpler and visibly right.

### Small sizes

At 32 px and below two things close up: the 4.2-unit cut between the strokes, and the 7.26-unit
crescent around the point. `psychsift-favicon.svg` is a separate optical variant for that range, and
it changes both.

The cut is widened to **7.2 units** by moving each facing edge 1.5 units away from the other, with
the blends re-solved against the lines they now meet. Because only the facing edges move, the outer
silhouette is identical to the one in the primary file.

The point slides **10 units out of its cradle**, to (54.8724, 20.0286), opening the crescent to
11.55 units. That widens the ink bounding box to 65.33, so this variant also carries its own
centring transform; the three changes are one set and must not be mixed with the primary variant's
placement. Below about 20 px the crescent is under two pixels and the point fuses into the S
whatever is done — that is the size, not the placement.

Use this variant for favicons, browser tabs, and anything rendered under 32 px.

### The maskable icon

`psychsift-mark-maskable.svg` is full-bleed, because Android crops adaptive icons to whatever shape
the launcher uses. Everything that must survive that crop has to sit inside a centred circle of
**66.7% of the icon's width**. The glyph is scaled to **62% of the height**, which puts its furthest
ink 160 px from the centre of a 512 px icon against the 171 px the safe circle allows. Do not raise
that 62%: an earlier draft used 58% with a different centring and still put ink 176 px out, outside
the safe circle.

## The wordmark

**Inter Display SemiBold**, tracked −0.02 em. The outlines are embedded as paths, so the lockups
render identically without Inter installed. Inter is licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1.

In the lockups the wordmark cap height is 42% of the mark's height, set one fifth of the mark's
height to its right, with the cap-height centre aligned to the mark's centre. In the tagline
version the tagline is tracked out to finish flush with the wordmark.

Note that the running application currently sets its interface in **Geist**, not Inter. The
wordmark is outlined artwork and is unaffected, but a wordmark set live in Geist would not match.

## Using it

- **Clear space**: keep a margin of at least one quarter of the mark's height on every side.
- **Never** re-space the two strokes, stretch the mark non-uniformly, add a shadow or gradient, or
  place the full-colour mark on a mid-tone background — use the light or reverse file instead.
- **Never** re-trace a PNG export. Start from the SVG.
- The mark carries `role="img"` and a `<title>`, so it is announced as "PsychSift" when inlined.
  When it sits next to the word PsychSift, mark it `aria-hidden` instead so screen readers do not
  say the name twice.

## Settled

**The tail tips.** Both tails end in a clean angled cut at about 81°. A flatter tail hook draws them
into finer points, closer to the blurry original; that version was drawn, compared and rejected by
the owner on 2026-08-28. Fine points thin both strokes, they belong with a curved middle line rather
than a straight one, and they are the first thing to disappear at 16 px. Do not revisit this without
a reason those three do not already answer.

## Two things still open

- The brand sheet gives two different taglines: "CLARITY. EVIDENCE. BETTER CARE." in the header and
  "Clinical clarity. Evidence. Better care." in the footer. The lockup uses the first.
- The sheet specifies Inter throughout; the application uses Geist. That difference should be
  settled deliberately rather than left to drift.
