# Ward Flow Phase 2 — kickoff brief for a fresh session

## Why a fresh session

Phase 1 was executed in a session that had already run five mockup rounds, a design brainstorm,
spec authoring, two plans and about fifteen subagent dispatches. Orchestration state is what
compaction destroys first, and a controller that forgets where it is re-dispatches completed work.
Each phase therefore gets its own session, starting cold from three files.

Continuity lives in the repository, not in a conversation:

| `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-ward-flow-metro-patient-flow-design.md`  | The binding authority, when a task needs the full requirement     |
| `docs/ward-flow-phase-handoff.md`                                           | Phase 1's rulings and parked findings in full                     |

## Before starting: open the app

Phase 1 ended green — 50 unit tests, lint clean, Chromium 6/6, whole-branch review clean after one
fix wave. It also shipped, at various points, a wait time labelled "1h 35m overdue" on every queue
row, a green tick beside "is not authorised under the Mental Health Act", and a bed grid that did
not reconcile on ten of twenty-two units. Every one passed tests and survived a review.

```bash
npm run ensure
```

Then open `/ward-management` and look at it. That is the check the process cannot perform.

## What Phase 2 builds

The flow coordinator's single screen — the surface that replaces the phone-around — in five
regions: emergency-department pressure strip, priority queue, flow diagram (departments left,
statewide flow centre, inpatient units right), explainable shortlist, exceptions drawer. Plus a
queue-first phone form, and the retirement of Constellation into it.

Ten tasks. Two build pure derivations (the operational score, per-department pressure), six build
the screen, one retires Constellation, one proves the phase.

## Process calibration recommended for this phase

Phase 1 used full subagent-driven development on every task. That was right for model work and it
caught real defects — but Phase 2 is mostly screens, and the same treatment would cost more than
it returns.

- **Full treatment** (implementer, task review, fix rounds) for Tasks 1, 2, 6 and 9 — the two
  derivations, the flow diagram, and the destructive retirement.
- **Single review seat** for Tasks 4, 5, 7 and 8 — screen regions rendering derivations that are
  already proved.
- **A screenshot pass on every screen task**, reviewed by the owner rather than only a subagent.
  This is the substitution for the second review seat, and it is the better instrument for this
  kind of defect.
- **Do not run** `verify:ui`, `verify:release`, or any provider-backed gate. The owner has asked
  for CI restraint; the plan's Task 10 names the gates that are in scope.
