# PsychSift — Codebase Index

> [!NOTE]
> **Historical Monorepo Index (PsychSift):**
> This codebase index describes the historical PsychSift clinical knowledge base architecture (Next.js + Supabase + OpenAI + Ingestion Worker).
> **In `BigSimmo/Ward-Flow`**, the active application is the standalone Ward Flow bed-coordination prototype. See [`docs/ward-flow/README.md`](ward-flow/README.md) and [`docs/ward-flow/code-map/README.md`](ward-flow/code-map/README.md) for current Ward Flow code and architecture. Supabase and ingestion workers are not present or active in this repository.

Structured map for AI agents and onboarding. For live routes, see `docs/site-map.md` (`npm run docs:update` / `sitemap:check`). For agent rules and verification gates, see `AGENTS.md`; for test execution and flake policy, see `docs/testing.md`.

**Stack:** Next.js 16, React 19, Supabase (pgvector, Storage, Auth), OpenAI, Python OCR worker.  
**Live Supabase:** `Clinical KB Database` — ref `sjrfecxgysukkwxsowpy` (never use stale `qjgitjyhxrwxsrydablr`).

## Quick start

| Step                              | Command                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confirm Supabase target           | `npm run check:supabase-project` (provider-backed — needs explicit confirmation) |
| Start app (project-specific port) | `npm run ensure`                                                                 |
| Start ingestion worker            | `npm run worker`                                                                 |
| Cheap verification gate           | `npm run verify:cheap`                                                           |
| UI verification gate              | `npm run verify:ui`                                                              |

## Orientation summary

The two blocks below were carried in `CLAUDE.md` until the instruction files were tiered.
They are reproduced verbatim; the detailed maps that follow supersede nothing here.

### Repository layout

```
src/app/          Next.js App Router — (search-app) route group, api/, auth/, mockups/
src/components/   UI; clinical-dashboard/ is the shell, *-mockups.tsx are design scratch
src/lib/          ~200 modules — rag/, supabase/, validation/, observability/,
                  extractors/, webhooks/ are the extracted subdirectories
src/data/         Static clinical content (DSM, formulation, therapies indexes)
data/             Generated clinical snapshot exports loaded at runtime — regenerate, never hand-edit
supabase/         migrations/ (source of truth), schema.sql (mirror), functions/
worker/           Ingestion worker; worker/python/ is the OCR stack

```

Never commit: `.next/`, `node_modules/`, `coverage/`, `.env*`, `sample-documents/`, logs.

The product surface is **17 app modes** (`src/lib/app-modes.ts`) sharing one search shell:
answer, documents, services, forms, favourites, differentials, dsm, specifiers, formulation,
prescribing, tools, calculators, therapy-compass, factsheets, dictionary, sources, on-call.

### The two flows that matter

**Answer (read path).** `/api/answer` → `src/lib/rag/rag.ts` orchestrates: hybrid retrieval
via Postgres RPCs (pgvector HNSW + tsvector/trigram) → `retrieval-selection` →
`answer-ranking` → routed OpenAI generation (fast vs strong) → `answer-verification` and
render policy → cited answer. If generation fails the quality gates it degrades to a
deterministic **source-only** answer that still cites real documents — that is expected
behaviour, not a bug. Responses cache in `rag_response_cache`.

**Ingestion (write path).** `/api/upload` → private `clinical-documents` bucket + a row in
`ingestion_jobs` → `worker/main.ts` (or the `indexing-v3-agent` Edge Function) claims the
job → extract (PDF/DOCX/XLSX/TXT) → OCR fallback → image captioning → chunking → OpenAI
embeddings → chunks, pages, images, embedding fields, index units, table facts → quality
gates in `document_index_quality`. Reindex commits atomically per generation
(`reindex-pipeline.ts`). Lifecycle detail: `docs/ingestion-state-machine.md`.

Both paths are owner-scoped: `owner-scope.ts`, `query-privacy.ts`, `authorization.ts`.

| `caring-contacts/` | Isolated Caring Contacts module migrations and local database-test runner. These migrations are deliberately separate from `supabase/migrations/` and must never target the `Clinical KB Database` Supabase project.                                                                                                |

Regenerate via the matching `scripts/import-*-export.ts` / `build-*-index.mjs`; do not hand-edit. Distinct from `src/data/`, which holds hand-authored static content.           |
| `eval/`            | Isolated evaluation labs, outside the product/runtime dependency graph. `eval/docling/` is the sandboxed, dispatch-only Docling extraction benchmark (own hashed Python lock + venvs, egress-blocked Docker run, synthetic fixtures + hostile corpus, aggregate-only reports; `docs/rag-improvement/README.md` §B3) |
| `eslint-rules/`    | Repo-specific lint rules enforced by `npm run lint` (button wiring, hardcoded hex, type/icon scale, z-index ladder)                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `.codex/`          | Trusted Desktop/CLI config; tracked `config.toml` has disabled, secret-free Figma, Supabase, Railway, and Sentry MCP templates. Hosted ChatGPT/Codex apps are installed and authenticated separately; OAuth stays in the host credential store.                                                                     |

## Application architecture

### Shell and routing

- **Root layout:** `src/app/layout.tsx` — fonts, `AuthProvider`, global CSS
- **Shared search-app layout:** `src/app/(search-app)/layout.tsx` + `src/components/clinical-dashboard/shared-search-app-shell.tsx` — keeps `GlobalSearchShell` mounted across mode homes
- **App shell:** `src/components/clinical-dashboard/global-search-shell.tsx` — canonical route-aware shell and lazy dashboard dispatch. The mockup-named module is a compatibility re-export used only below `/mockups`.
- **PWA:** `docs/pwa.md` — install assets, privacy-first service worker/offline shell, lifecycle, security, and verification
- **Home:** `src/app/(search-app)/page.tsx` — dashboard rendered by shell
- **Dashboard:** `src/components/ClinicalDashboard.tsx` + `src/components/clinical-dashboard/`
- **Modes (16):** `src/lib/app-modes.ts` — answer, documents, services, forms, favourites, differentials, DSM-5 diagnosis, specifiers, formulation, prescribing, tools, calculators, Therapy, Factsheets, Dictionary, Sources
  - **Sources catalogue:** `/sources` provides a read-only, quality-banded catalogue with Topics, Publishers, Method and source-detail traceability; `/dictionary/sources` redirects into its Dictionary-filtered view. Method (`/sources/method`) and the Guide Centre's Source rating topic both render `src/components/reference/source-method-reference-content.tsx` — one component, `variant: "page" | "guide"`, the same arrangement `colour-coding-reference-content.tsx` uses for `/reference/colour-coding`.
  - **Therapy review disclosure.** Therapy was `devOnly` while its 205-record catalogue awaited qualified-clinician sign-off. That hid the mode from production navigation, 404'd `/therapy-compass` in the route layout, and made `therapyRecordsForEnvironment` filter every record out — so all 205 detail/brief/sheet routes and every universal-search therapy hit 404'd for real users while working locally. The owner's decision (2026-08-19) replaced the gate with disclosure: reachability is no longer conditioned on review status anywhere, and the caveat is stated per record instead, by the `reviewStatus` badge on every card, detail page, brief, sheet, comparison, pathway, and universal-search result. A catalogue-wide banner (`TherapyReviewNotice`, counts from the generated `THERAPY_CATALOGUE_SUMMARY.needsReviewCount`) sat above the search band until 2026-09-06, when the owner removed it: a caveat repeated above every search is read past, while the per-record badge sits where the decision is actually made. `therapyNeedsReview` survives as the label source only. Pinned by `tests/app-modes.test.ts` (reachability), `tests/therapy-review-regressions.test.ts` (the per-record badges, and the banner's absence), and `tests/therapy-pr-unblocking-contract.test.ts` (the retired `PLAYWRIGHT_OFFLINE_MODE` bypass that existed only to reach the gated route).

## `src/lib/` module map

> **26 September 2026 note:** This module map (RAG, ingestion, most of source governance, Caring
> Contacts, On Call mode, clinical product data, infra helpers, and most of Supabase/auth/env) was
> written for PsychSift's pre-retirement `src/lib/`. That removal deleted most of the files named
> below; today's `src/lib/` is far smaller (run `git ls-files src/lib/` for the live list). The map
> itself remains accurate on `origin/main`.

### RAG, retrieval, answers

The `rag.ts` orchestrator and its `rag-*` cluster live in **`src/lib/rag/`** (the first
domain-extracted directory; imported as `@/lib/rag/rag*`). Other modules below remain flat in
`src/lib/`.

### Caring Contacts

`src/lib/caring-contacts/` is an isolated, synthetic caring-contact domain. It uses only
relative imports within its directory, provides deny-by-default team-scoped permissions and
privacy-safe audit records, and is exercised against both in-memory and local Postgres
repositories. `src/lib/caring-contacts-server/` is the server-side seam for the demo session
and optional separate database connection. It must fail closed in production and must never
connect to the `Clinical KB Database` Supabase project. The standalone `src/app/caring-contacts/` workspace
is noindex, visibly marked synthetic, and has a single inbound entry from the Tools catalogue.

Inside the workspace, `src/components/caring-contacts/workspace/shell.tsx` owns the whole
destination set: a destination carries an `href` only once its page exists, and every other one
renders as an unavailable control that states what it will hold (Ruling 52). `/caring-contacts`
(Today), `/caring-contacts/patients` (the caseload), `/caring-contacts/patients/[patientId]`
(one patient's episode), `/caring-contacts/plans/new` (the activation wizard),
`/caring-contacts/schedule` (the team's day),
`/caring-contacts/templates` (the governed pathway versions),
`/caring-contacts/templates/[pathwayId]` (one of them in full), `/caring-contacts/guidance`,
`/caring-contacts/reports` and `/caring-contacts/team` are what is built so far. Every one of them is a page that reads the
store through `auditedRead` rather than over HTTP, using the same access identity the matching API
route records; filtering and, on the patient overview, the choice of which plan to open are carried
in the URL and read by the Server Component.

The More panel carries the destinations the rail does not, and its entries carry an `href` under the
same Ruling 89 rule. It ALSO carries the primary destinations the phone bar has no room for, in a
`md:hidden` row derived from the two arrays rather than listed — which is what makes
`/caring-contacts/templates` reachable below 768px, where there is no rail. It was not:
`tests/route-reachability.test.ts` reads `shell.tsx` as text and cannot see which array an `href`
sits in or what CSS governs it, so it passed on a shipped route no phone could reach. The assertion
that can fail on that walks the rendered ancestor chain, in
`tests/caring-contacts-workspace-shell.dom.test.tsx`, and clicks the link at 390px in
`tests/ui-caring-contacts-workspace.spec.ts`.

`/caring-contacts/reports` performs NO read of `caring_contacts.cultural_identity_reports`. Spec §2.5
promises reach reporting over Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, and this system records
none — so the screen states what is and is not collected instead of rendering an empty breakdown,
which would read as a statement about patients rather than about collection. The two halves of §2.5
are in different states and the screen says so: the small-cell threshold IS set (the owner's decision
of 2026-08-26, held with its provenance in `src/lib/caring-contacts/reach-reporting-governance.ts`,
which is the file a governance change opens and the only place the number appears); a bounded
category set is not. The suppression rule itself lives in
`src/lib/caring-contacts/reach-reporting.ts`: it takes the threshold as a required argument, refuses
one too low to hide anything, and suppresses complementary cells so that no hidden figure is
recoverable by subtracting the published ones from a total.

`/caring-contacts/team` renders `buildTeamWorkload` and draws three FEWER columns than the approved
design does, each because nothing in this system holds the value (Task 17's findings 1–3, and none of
them is an oversight). There is no staff display NAME: the stores hold an `ActorId` and nothing else
about a person, and a staff directory is a system this build is not connected to — so the identifier
is rendered as an identifier and the screen states that a name is not held. There is no ROLE column:
nothing returns the roles an `ActorId` holds, `Actor` being assembled at the session seam for the one
person acting. And there is no per-member UNCLAIMED count, because unclaimed means there is no owner
to file the work under; the design's unclaimed row is rendered once, above both the desktop table and
the compact roster, as the spec §4.4 pair — the escalation as an `AutomatedState` carrying the
threshold that produced it and the one thing that clears it. Both ages it shows are upper bounds
measured from the earliest instant the work could have been waiting, and are named for that rather
than called a queue age. Its Reassign work control is a link to the caseload: a reassignment needs
one plan, this read deliberately carries no plan id, and the control that performs one already exists
on `plan-actions.tsx`.

`/caring-contacts/templates` is a governance record viewer, and the LIBRARY shows no message wording
at all. Ruling [127]: the one patient-visible message that exists is a specimen rather than a
template, and there is no per-version message content anywhere, so a library that printed wording
beside a version would claim a relationship the data does not have. The DETAIL route
`/caring-contacts/templates/[pathwayId]` does show the wording, because a record states what it
holds where a list cannot: it reads `snapshot.messageTextByType` back verbatim and never assembles
a string. Beside it, the route states the wording's approval status in `message-copy.ts`'s own
words — provisional, not clinically approved — read from the sealed domain rather than retyped
(Ruling [131]), because a version's dual approval approves the VERSION and nothing in this system
has approved the words. What both routes carry is `PathwayVersionSnapshot.provenance`, resolved
through `pathwayVersionProvenanceWording` so that an approval line can never stand unqualified over
a record nobody approved.

The Schedule screen is the one that must not let two different days read the same. `disposition`
alone cannot separate a quiet day from a stopped one, so the screen states each day from `counts`,
which partition a day with nothing due into already-sent, held-by-its-own-plan and never-will-be; a
plan somebody created and never started is surfaced as its own automated state, because a discharged
patient receiving nothing while the plan record looks complete is an operational failure rather than
a quiet day. It derives no schedule rule of its own -- the windows, the holds, the exceptions and the
counts all come from `src/lib/caring-contacts/schedule-view.ts` -- and it is the one workspace screen
that deliberately does NOT read `listPatientNames`, so that the trail row meaning "somebody read
patients' names" is not written every time a coordinator glances at a day.

`/caring-contacts/plans/new` is the one screen with a deliberate client boundary (Ruling [109]).
The page itself is still a Server Component -- it makes the audited reads, decides the actor's
capability, and fails closed -- and it hands a lazily-imported `PlanWizard` the referral and the
approved pathway versions, and nothing else. The service state, which carries an incident note,
stays on the server; `plan-wizard/stages.ts` is where Tasks 8 and 9 flip stages 3 and 4 from
unbuilt to built, and the wizard's in-progress draft lives in `sessionStorage` alone
(`plan-wizard/plan-draft.ts`, Ruling [110]).

The patient overview is the only screen permitted to call `getEpisode`, which is the one read that
releases a patient's name, mobile number, identifiers and cultural identity together. Every other
screen is built to avoid it: the caseload uses `listPatientNames`, the names-only projection
(Ruling 91). The overview calls it once, for one plan, and only after Ruling 97's rule has settled
which plan — the route is keyed by patient, the reads are keyed by plan, and one patient can
honestly hold two episodes, so the screen presents them and never picks. Ruling 94: do not restate

The Patients caseload carries the workspace's other deliberate client boundary, and it exists for a
confidentiality rule rather than a browser capability. Its search matches the patient's NAME, and
while the box was a `method="get"` form that name travelled as `?q=` — into the address bar of a
possibly-shared ward computer's history and the access log of every proxy in between. Ruling [111]
forbids exactly that, so the typed text is React state in `patients-directory-client.tsx` and reaches
no URL in any form. The page around it stays a Server Component and the payload it hands over is
SMALLER than the HTML it replaced: rows are reduced to the row projection and pre-filtered by plan
state on the server side.
that as a count of client components — this paragraph has carried two such counts and both were
wrong. What holds Ruling 13 is the module boundary, which does not decay as files are added:
nothing outside the `/caring-contacts` route segment imports the workspace (the tools catalogue
names it by href, never by import), so the dashboard references no chunk exclusive to it.

### On Call mode

The junior-doctor operations hub: the owner's **own** service information — numbers, escalation
routes, referral pathways, orientation, teaching and logistics. Six sections, one row shape.

**It carries no app-authored clinical content.** Every entry is written by the owner, and the mode
states only what they typed. What it does add is provenance: each entry records when it was last
verified, and `entry-model` derives a twelve-month staleness state from that date rather than storing
one, so a number that has not been confirmed in a year is labelled stale wherever it appears — and
the printable card excludes stale entries outright.

`src/lib/on-call/`:

| Module           | Role                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entry-model`    | The six section ids, per-section `.strict()` Zod schemas, and the twelve-month freshness rule |
| `repository`     | Owner-scoped reads of `on_call_entries`; throws rather than query without an owner id         |
| `api-schemas`    | Create/update request shapes (kept out of the route files, which may export only route names) |
| `entry-store`    | Browser cache over `createBrowserStore`, cleared on sign-out and session expiry               |
| `search`         | Offline search across all six sections, over the cached entries                               |
| `card-selection` | Which entries reach the printable card: on-card, not personal, not stale                      |

Routes live at `/on-call/<section>` (`contacts`, `playbook`, `referrals`, `orientation`,
`education`, `logistics`) plus `/on-call/search` and `/on-call/card`; components are in
`src/components/on-call/`. The API is `/api/on-call/entries`, `[id]`, and `[id]/verify` — the last
being the one-tap "still correct today" action that resets the freshness clock.

**Storage.** `on_call_entries` is owner-scoped with RLS enabled and revoked from `anon` and
`authenticated`; reads and writes go through the service-role client at the API layer, the same
application-layer ownership model as `clinical_registry_records`.

**Flow:** Administrator backend upload → Storage + job queue → worker parses (PDF/DOCX/XLSX/TXT) → OCR fallback → image captioning → chunking → OpenAI embeddings → pgvector. The site does not expose a user document-upload workflow.

**Run:** `npm run worker` or `npm run worker:once`

## Domain concepts

### Indexing pipeline

1. Administrator backend upload via `/api/upload` → `clinical-documents` bucket
2. Queue `ingestion_jobs` (+ optional `import_batches`)
3. **Worker** (`worker/main.ts`) or **Edge agent** (`indexing-v3-agent`) processes: extract → chunk → embed → write chunks, pages, images, embedding fields, index units, table facts
4. Quality gates: `document_index_quality`, enrichment versions, strict completion RPCs
5. Reindex: atomic generation commits (`reindex-pipeline.ts`), abandoned generation recovery

### RAG

> On the Ward Flow line this pipeline does not exist: `rag.ts` and the retrieval/generation code
> it describes left with PsychSift on 26 September 2026. Kept for orientation only; current on
> `origin/main`.

- Hybrid retrieval: pgvector HNSW + lexical (tsvector/trigram) via Postgres RPCs
- Answer routing: fast vs strong models; `RAG_PROVIDER_MODE` (auto/openai/offline)
- Caching: `rag_response_cache`, app-layer caches in `env.ts`
- Eval: `npm run eval:quality`, `eval:retrieval`

Answer request flow (`rag.ts` orchestrates retrieval → ranking → generation →
verification; failed generation degrades to a deterministic source-only answer):

```

### PsychSift surface

> On the Ward Flow line none of these 17 app modes exist: they left with PsychSift on 26
> September 2026. Kept for orientation only; current on `origin/main`.

- 17 app modes with unified search shell
- Documents mode: browse indexed guidelines, search, scope, and inspect cited answers; document uploads remain in the administrator backend
- Answer mode: grounded Q&A with PDF-linked citations
- Registry modes: services, forms, medications, differentials; Formulation is a local mechanism and structured-draft workspace
- Demo mode: synthetic data when Supabase unavailable (`demo-data.ts`, `isDemoMode()` in `env.ts`)

### Ward Flow (`src/app/mockups/ward-flow/`, `src/components/ward-management/`)

Synthetic prototype for WA metro psychiatry patient flow: getting a patient from an emergency
department to an inpatient psychiatric bed. Offline and fixture-backed — no provider calls, no
persistence, no patient-identifiable data. Advisory only: the system proposes destinations with
visible reasons and a human confirms or overrides.

Developer-gated sandbox, reached only through the developer page (`/mockups/development`), the
same pattern as the Care Plan and Caring Contacts prototypes: `"/mockups/ward-flow"` is on
`DEVELOPER_GATED_PATH_PREFIXES` (`src/lib/developer-area/headers.ts`), so `src/proxy.ts` lets it
through the blanket `/mockups` production block and `DeveloperAreaGate`
(`src/app/mockups/ward-flow/layout.tsx`) requires a signed-in administrator instead of rendering
the prototype to an anonymous visitor. The move relocated and re-gated the route tree, and the
Tools catalogue entry (`src/lib/tools-catalog.ts`, id `ward-management`) has since been removed,
along with the applications-launcher, tools-search-results, and category-identity mentions that
keyed off it, so the developer hub panel is the only entry point.

- **Design spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-ward-flow-metro-patient-flow-design.md`
- **Glossary:** `docs/ward-management-context.md` · **Decisions:** `docs/ward-management-decisions.md`
- **Route/role map:** `docs/ward-management-mode-map.md`
- **Model:** `src/components/ward-management/ward-clock.ts` (the only module that reads the
  wall clock), `ward-model.ts` (domain types only), `ward-eligibility.ts` (the eight
  placement gates), `ward-sites.ts` (17 sites, 8 emergency departments, 22 units),
  `ward-movements.ts` (48 movements, 9 bed releases), `ward-derivations.ts` (shared pure UI
  derivations)
- **Surfaces:** `ward-management-console.tsx` (command), `ward-management-modes.tsx` (mode
  workspaces), `ward-management-network.tsx` (network diagram), `ward-management-navigation.tsx`,
  `src/app/mockups/ward-flow/constellation/page.tsx` (retired constellation; server redirect to
  `/mockups/ward-flow/network`), `coordinator/coordinator-screen.tsx` (Phase 3 live coordinator screen — priority queue, statewide
  flow diagram, explainable shortlist), `ward/ward-screen.tsx` (Task 8: one inpatient unit's own
  view — `/mockups/ward-flow/ward/[unitId]`; capacity confirmation, incoming-referral accept/hold/
  decline, restriction notices, withdrawn referrals), `officer/officer-screen.tsx` (Task 9: the
  transport officer's phone — `/mockups/ward-flow/transport/officer`; every transport job not yet
  arrived, since `TransportJob` carries a `provider` organisation and no officer identity;
  queue-plus-pinned-action-bar pattern inherited from `shortlist-panel.tsx`, one job "active" at a
  time with its four transport actions — accepted, en route, collected, arrived — pinned to the
  viewport bottom on phone widths), `tracker/live-tracker.tsx` (Task 10: the coordinator's live
  tracker, rewriting the existing route — `/mockups/ward-flow/transport`; every open movement that
  carries a transport job, its leg via `tracker/tracker-derivations.ts`'s `trackerRowState`
  (delegating to `transportLeg`) and how long since that leg's own stamp via `stampAgeText`; a
  movement with no transport job at all is never listed as a row — the banner states the excluded
  count in real text instead, the same on-screen-honesty discipline as the officer screen's "no
  officer identity" notice), `ed/ed-screen.tsx` (Task 11: one emergency department's own view —
  `/mockups/ward-flow/ed/[edId]`, resolved via `ward-sites.ts`'s `edById`; both clocks (time in
  department from `openedAt`, the legal clock from `formedAt` where earlier, marked
  `data-community-formed`), the 24-hour `ED_ACCESS_TARGET_MINUTES` departmental access target
  — labelled and computed so it can never be mistaken for a legal deadline and never touches a
  `LegalForm`/`dueAt` — a police-attendance flag, and each movement's single outstanding item; a
  raise-referral form (`RAISE_REFERRAL`), a record-examination form (`RECORD_EXAMINATION`), and
  the mark-handover-ready control (`HANDOVER_READY`) that is the only producer of a transport job;
  statewide capacity shown read-only), `handover/handover-page.tsx` (Phase 4 Task 4: the shift
  handover — `/mockups/ward-flow/handover`; four fixed, product-owner-approved sections in a fixed
  order (longest waits, beds held, in transit, placement gone wrong) built by `ward-derivations.ts`'s
  `handoverSnapshot`; read once from `useWardFlow()` inside a `useState` initialiser so the page is
  frozen at the moment it is opened and never re-derives on the 30-second clock tick; every section
  renders an explicit "None" line rather than hiding itself when empty; a Print button calls
  `window.print()`, styled by `handover.module.css`'s own `@media print` block), `escalation/escalation-board.tsx`
  (Phase 4 Task 5: the escalation board — `/mockups/ward-flow/escalation`; one place showing every
  patient whose placement has gone wrong, via `ward-derivations.ts`'s `escalationBoard`; two
  independently-computed, read-only sections — `escalated` (movements carrying a recorded
  `Movement.escalation`: when, `triedUnitIds` resolved to real `Unit` objects, contact, wait) and
  `nowhereEligible` (open movements with zero eligible wards right now, via `eligibleCandidatesAmong`
  called with an unlimited-effective `limit` so nothing truncates); a movement can appear in both, and
  on the real fixture at `NOW_ANCHOR` WF-009 does — it has a recorded escalation and, independently,
  still has nowhere eligible. Unlike the handover, this page is NOT frozen: it reads the live clock on
  every render, since a coordinator working this board wants the current picture. Records and shows
  only — it computes no near-miss, no least-bad option, and no statement of what would need to change
  for a ward to work), `search/patient-search.tsx` (Phase 4 Task 7: patient search — `/mockups/ward-flow/search`;
  product owner's choice: its own page, reached from the left-hand menu, rather than a box on the
  coordinator screen. A single live filter over `ward-derivations.ts`'s `searchMovements` — a free-text
  field matching movement id, `originEdId`, the resolved destination unit's id/name, the stage's own
  display label and `owner`, plus an exact-match stage `<select>` and department `<select>`, all three
  combining as AND. Scoped to OPEN movements only (`isOpen`, applied before any other filter, so a
  closed movement can never surface even when the query is its own id verbatim) and, like the
  escalation board and unlike the frozen handover, reads the live `useWardFlow()` clock on every
  render. Renders an explicit "No matches" note rather than an empty table when nothing fits. This is
  the page's own single search composer — Ward Flow routes never mount the shared global shell
  composer, so nothing else on the page competes with it)
- **State layer (Phase 3):** `ward-flow-provider.tsx` (`WardFlowProvider`/`useWardFlow`, mounted at
  `src/app/mockups/ward-flow/layout.tsx`), `ward-flow-reducer.ts` (the one mutation path),
  `ward-flow-events.ts` (event/role table)
- **Tests:** `tests/ward-management.test.ts`, `tests/ui-ward-management.spec.ts`,
  `tests/ui-ward-coordinator.spec.ts`, `tests/ui-ward-roles.spec.ts`, `tests/ward-handover.test.ts`
  (`handoverSnapshot`), `tests/ward-handover.dom.test.tsx` (the freeze and every section's empty
  state), `tests/ward-escalation.test.ts` (`escalationBoard`, including the standard-night
  `WF-009`/`WF-308` and scarce-night nine-movement measurements), `tests/ward-escalation.dom.test.tsx`
  (both sections and their empty states), `tests/ward-patient-search.test.ts` (`searchMovements`,
  including the closed-movement exclusion proven against both a real and a constructed fixture case),
  `tests/ward-patient-search.dom.test.tsx` (the single-composer shape, live results, and the
  "No matches" empty state)

### Developer hub (`src/app/mockups/development/`, `src/lib/developer-area/`)

Login-gated internal hub for repository/task state, reachable only to a signed-in administrator
account (`DeveloperAreaGate`, `src/components/developer-area/developer-area-gate.tsx`; gate helpers
`src/lib/developer-area/access.ts` + `headers.ts` — see the Supabase/auth/env table above). Phase 2
shipped four more live panels (routes and modes, documentation, test health, review state) on top
of Phase 1's task ledger. Phase 3 shipped the ingestion panel (below) and pruned four placeholder
registry entries (`errors`, `budgets`, `commands`, `decision-log`) that each restated a fact a gate
or another document already guarantees — see the removal comment in `hub-panels.ts`. `hazard-register`
(clinical) is the one remaining phase-4 placeholder, kept deliberately as a clinical-safety surface
under reconsideration rather than developer tooling; `database-drift` (system) is deliberately not
built — `live-drift.yml` already creates and updates a GitHub issue on drift, so a panel would restate
what that gate guarantees (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-25-developer-hub-ingestion-panel.md` §2).

- **Panel registry:** `src/lib/developer-area/hub-panels.ts` (`HUB_PANELS`, `panelsInGroup`) — one
  entry per panel with its `group` (`work` | `clinical` | `system` | `reference`) and delivery
  `phase` (1 = built now; 2–4 = declared placeholder with no `href` yet). Shipping a later-phase
  panel is flipping its phase and adding an `href`. The `work-in-flight` id is kept stable across
  its Phase 2 rename to "Review state" — the id is the extension mechanism, not the label.
- **Repo awareness snapshot:** `src/lib/developer-area/repo-awareness-types.ts` declares the
  snapshot's shape (`RepoAwarenessSnapshot`, `REPO_AWARENESS_SNAPSHOT_VERSION`), shared by the
  generator and the reader. `scripts/generate-repo-awareness-snapshot.ts` builds
  `data/repo-awareness-snapshot.json` from the route walker, the docs tree, the flake ledger, and
  the review records; it runs as the last step of `npm run docs:update`. `src/lib/developer-area/
repo-awareness-snapshot.ts` (`loadRepoAwarenessSnapshot`) is the typed reader, with a version
  guard that throws loudly on an unrecognised snapshot rather than silently under-reporting the
  repository. `scripts/check-repo-awareness-snapshot.ts` (`npm run check:repo-awareness-snapshot`)
  fails when the committed snapshot is behind the repository it describes. `src/lib/developer-area/
freshness.ts` is the label-agnostic content-age helper both the ledger and the repo-awareness
  pages use to render their freshness stamp.
- **What the snapshot deliberately does NOT commit, and why:** the gate compares only `routes`,
  `documentation` and `test_health`. The two keys it excludes are excluded because they change on
  both sides of every concurrent append, and a committed field that always differs is a merge
  conflict — which sets `mergeable_state=dirty` on GitHub, suppresses `refs/pull/<n>/merge`, and
  leaves the PR check list reading empty rather than red. So the excluded keys carry only content
  that can merge: `review_state.records` is ordered by `head` (a uniformly distributed sha, so two
  branches appending a review record land far apart), it stores no aggregate `counts`
  (`reviewStateCounts()` derives them at render), and `REVISION_INPUTS` excludes the review corpus
  so a review-ledger update no longer moves `captured_revision`. Adding anything back to those keys
  means meeting the same bar: too volatile to compare is too volatile to commit in a conflicting
  shape.
- **The gate needs git, and says so when it has none:** `check:repo-awareness-snapshot` reaches git
  through the generator (`git ls-files`, `git log`), so in a checkout with no git — a `git archive`
  export, or a container image without `.git` — it logs `Skipped: no git repository rooted here`
  and exits **0**. A skip and a pass share that exit code, so read the message, not the code. The
  check is deliberately "a repository ROOTED HERE" rather than "inside a work tree": an export
  extracted inside another checkout answers `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` with the outer
  repository's `true`, and the generator then reads that repository, finds every document
  untracked, and fails with an unexplained six-hundred-path error. Nothing is lost by skipping —
  CI always runs this gate against a real checkout.
- **Task ledger data:** the outstanding-issues ledger snapshot and its generator/check scripts were
  retired on the Ward Flow line on 26 September 2026 at Josh's request; the PsychSift version
  remains on `origin/main`. Ward Flow's own work is tracked in `docs/ward-flow-task-ledger.md`.
  `resolveQualitySpread`) verifies the signed-in administrator through `createSupabaseServerClient`,
  then reads `public.documents` and `public.document_index_quality` through the server-only
  `createAdminClient`. `authenticated` has no table `SELECT` privilege on either table, so every
  service-role query explicitly filters `owner_id` to that verified user. The admin client bypasses
  RLS, making that application-enforced filter the access boundary; tests cover non-administrator
  denial and fail if any recorded query omits it. Every failure reports as `null` and never as `0`, and each read is guarded
  separately, because on this panel `0` is the reassuring answer and a rejected request must not be
  able to impersonate it. Counts are computed in Postgres (`head: true`) rather than by counting
  fetched rows, which PostgREST would cap. `resolveQualitySpread` is the pure derivation that tells
  a real score distribution apart from every document carrying one repeated placeholder — the
  reading that would otherwise make the quality half of the panel look like a measurement.
  `src/lib/developer-area/clinical-answer-failures.ts` (`resolveClinicalAnswerFailures`,
  `referencedQuestionCount`) is its sibling over the ledger and the RAG eval case list.
- **Routes:** `/mockups/development` (`page.tsx`, Server Component) — the grouped hub: environment
  strip, a blocking-items callout when the ledger has P1s, then one section per non-empty panel
  group. `/mockups/development/ledger` (`ledger/page.tsx`, Server Component) — the task ledger
  page: freshness stamp, count tiles, a "blocking now" callout, the recommended running order
  (acuity — urgency, kept deliberately separate from priority), open items grouped by priority,
  and pending inbox requests. `/mockups/development/routes` — every page and every app mode, from
  the repo awareness snapshot's route walk. `/mockups/development/documentation` — every tracked
  document, its area, and whether the codebase index lists it. `/mockups/development/test-health`
  — unstable and quarantined tests, from the flake ledger. `/mockups/development/review-state` —
  which branches were reviewed, at which head, with what outcome, from the committed review
  records; deliberately scoped to that recorded history rather than live pull-request/CI state,
  which the repository has no access to without a network call. `/mockups/development/ingestion`
  (`page.tsx`, Server Component rendering the client `IngestionPanel`) — whether an uploaded
  document actually indexed: queued, processing, finished, or stuck, polled live from
  `/api/ingestion/jobs` rather than a build-time snapshot (the one panel that cannot use one — a
  stuck-job snapshot could be stale within seconds). Distinguishes four reasons the endpoint can
  return nothing (demo mode, unauthenticated/non-administrator `401`/`403` — the normal local
  experience, since `DeveloperAreaGate` no-ops outside production while the endpoint still enforces
  administrator auth everywhere — genuinely zero jobs, and the fetch itself failing) and buckets any
  job `status` this panel does not recognise (the column is a plain `string`, not an enum) under its
  own "Other status" section, verbatim, rather than dropping it.
  `/mockups/development/clinical-answer-failures` — open ledger items that name one of the
  repository's clinical eval questions by case id, presented as references rather than as verdicts.
  `/mockups/development/corpus-health` (`corpus-health/page.tsx`, Server Component) — the library at
  rest rather than in flight: counts by status, documents that finished `indexed` with zero chunks,
  failures with the recorded reason, and the extraction-quality distribution. It authenticates via
  the user-session client, then reads through the server-only, owner-filtered admin path. Every page
  in this directory inherits `DeveloperAreaGate` from `layout.tsx`.
- **Components:** `src/components/developer-area/developer-hub-nav-header.tsx` (`"use client"`,
  owns the hub's in-page section table and mounts `InPageNavHeader`) and
  `src/components/developer-area/hub/` — `freshness-stamp.tsx`, `environment-strip.tsx`,
  `panel-card.tsx` (a Client Component because it renders an inert click handler for
  not-yet-built panels), `ledger-item.tsx`, `panel-page-shell.tsx` (back link, title, and a
  required `freshnessLabel` so a page can never silently inherit the stamp's "Ledger" default),
  `panel-primitives.tsx` (renamed from `count-tile.tsx` once it outgrew tile-only scope — the
  shared `CountTile`, the `CARD_CLASS`/`ROW_CLASS`/`MONO_CLASS`/`SECTION_HEADING_CLASS`/
  `META_CLASS` building blocks the developer sub-pages render their headline numbers and record
  cards with), `quarantine-list.tsx` (the quarantined-test list, kept outside `test-health/page.tsx`
  because a page module may only export the framework's reserved names), `ingestion-panel.tsx`
  (`"use client"`, `IngestionPanel` — fetch-on-mount plus a `pollAfterMs`-driven re-fetch that stops
  the moment the server reports no active jobs; renders its own live "last checked" stamp via
  `resolveFreshnessFrom`, since `PanelPageShell`'s own stamp is filled in server-side before any
  client fetch happens and therefore says "revision unknown" on this one page by design).
- **Tests:** `tests/developer-area-access.test.ts`, `tests/developer-hub-panels.test.ts`,
  `tests/developer-ledger-snapshot.test.ts`, `tests/developer-hub-components.dom.test.tsx`,
  `tests/developer-hub-page.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/developer-ledger-page.dom.test.tsx`,

### Care Plan (`src/app/mockups/care-plan/`, `src/components/care-plan/mockups/`)

> On the Ward Flow line this prototype does not exist: `src/app/mockups/care-plan/` and
> `src/components/care-plan/` left with PsychSift on 26 September 2026. Kept for orientation only;
> current on `origin/main`.

Synthetic, memory-only, provider-free prototype for finding people with recurrent psychiatric
emergency-department presentations and making their current management plan easy to find and use.
Twenty-one routes under one gated prefix; every record is fictional, nothing is persisted, and a
refresh restores the fixtures. Design authority: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-20-care-plan-design.md`;
terminology: `docs/care-plan-context.md`; build history and rulings: `docs/care-plan/sdd-ledger.md`.

- **Gate:** `/mockups/care-plan` and everything beneath it is behind `DeveloperAreaGate`
  (`layout.tsx`) and the production block in `src/proxy.ts`, which matches the exact prefix so a
  look-alike such as `/mockups/care-plan-archive` is not let through.
- **Routes:** `route-page.tsx` renders one client suite for every address. Home, `patients`,
  `patients/[patientId]`, and per patient `management-plan{,/edit,/review,/print}`,
  `patient-plan{,/edit,/print}`, `safety-plan{,/edit,/print}`, `presentations{,/new,/[presentationId]}`,
  `history`; plus `reviews`, `team`, `governance`, `system-states`. Addresses are built only by
  `routes.ts` (`CARE_PLAN_BASE`, `CARE_PLAN_ROUTES`, `carePlanRoute`); a query string may name a
  deterministic specimen scenario and nothing else.
- **State:** `prototype-state.ts` (reducer, ~85 kB, single-Current invariant, capability checks and
  `getPrototypeMutationBlockReason` re-checked on every action), `prototype-provider.tsx`,
  `domain.ts` (pure selectors), `fixtures.ts` + `patient-plan-fixtures.ts` (all `SYN-` identifiers),
  `types.ts`.
- **Surfaces:** `routable-suite.tsx` (address → surface), `care-plan-shell-frame.tsx` (rail, phone
  dock, More sheet, one search slot), `clinical-snapshot-page.tsx`, `patient-workspace.tsx`,
  `patient-navigation.tsx`, `management-plan-{read,form,review,print,diff}.tsx`,
  `patient-plan-{pages,form,transform}.ts{,x}`, `safety-plan-{pages,form}.tsx`,
  `presentation-{pages,form,timeline}.tsx`, `history-page.tsx`, `operations-pages.tsx`
  (Reviews/Team/Governance), `system-states-page.tsx`, `care-plan-error-boundary.tsx`,
  `care-plan.module.css`.
- **Printing:** all three print surfaces consume the shared `PrintOutput`/`PrintSection`/
  `BrowserPrintButton` primitives in `src/components/ui/print-output.tsx`; the print cascade itself
  lives in `src/app/globals.css`.
- **Tests:** `tests/care-plan-domain.test.ts`, `tests/care-plan-prototype-state.test.ts`,
  `tests/care-plan-patient-plan.test.ts`, `tests/care-plan-route-files.test.ts`,
  `tests/care-plan-linked-routes.dom.test.tsx`, the gate cases in `tests/proxy.test.ts`, and the
  browser suite `tests/ui-care-plan-mockup.spec.ts` (`npm run test:e2e:care-plan-mockup`, advisory
  `chromium-mockups` project only).

### Global search composer placement rules

One shared composer (`master-search-header.tsx`) serves every mode. Placement:

- **Mode homes**: all 17 modes use the one shared home at `/?mode=<id>` (including Answer at `/`), while two routes still own a functional home of their own — `/favourites` (a hub) and `/tools` (a launcher). Neither is a duplicate of the shared home; each is its mode's own functional surface. `/sources` was a third until its four-card `ModeHomeTemplate` home was retired: it duplicated the shared home's title and subtitle, and its cards duplicated the Sources tab bar, so it was deleted and the bare path consolidated. The catalogue keeps its own route at `/sources/search`, historically reached through ShowAllChip (retired from the Ward Flow line on 27 September 2026). Composer inline in the hero via the `mode-home-composer-slot` portal, on phone and tablet+ alike. Fourteen modes are now consolidated onto the shared home, via two different mechanisms: `/services`, `/forms`, `/differentials`, `/dsm`, `/specifiers`, `/formulation`, `/calculators`, `/factsheets`, `/dictionary`, `/therapy-compass`, `/documents`, `/sources` and `/on-call` (whose six section pages live under `/on-call/<section>`) are `redirect()` stubs registered in `consolidatedModeHomePaths` (`src/lib/consolidated-mode-home-redirect.ts`, resolved in `src/proxy.ts` so they emit a real 307 rather than a streamed meta-refresh). `/medications` is consolidated too, but through its own bespoke redirect (`medications/page.tsx` plus a matching fast-path, `medicationsHomeTarget()`, in `src/proxy.ts`) — it stays out of `consolidatedModeHomePaths` because it has no separate `/medications/search` route for that map's generic `${pathname}/search` submitted-target logic to forward to; its submitted searches already went straight to `/?mode=prescribing&q=…&run=1` before this change, and still do. Do not assume Medications is in the shared map — a reader who does will go looking for a results route that does not exist. Calculators and Dictionary are full modes in this inventory, not route aliases. Their per-mode copy is `sharedHomePresentation` in `src/lib/ui-copy.ts`. (`/applications` is a redirect to `/tools`, not a mode or composer surface.)
- **Information (detail) pages**: catalogue/record routes under each mode (`/services/[slug]`, `/forms/[slug]`, `/medications/[slug]`, `/specifiers/[slug]`, `/formulation/[slug]`, `/factsheets/[slug]`, `/dictionary/[slug]`, `/dictionary/topics/[slug]`, `/therapy-compass/[slug]`, `/dsm/diagnoses/[slug]`, …). Route detection: `src/lib/information-pages.ts` (`isInformationPage`). Shared outer chrome: `src/components/information-page-shell.tsx` (`InformationPageShell`, breadcrumbs, optional footer). Specifier/formulation mode shells re-export that primitive. Intentional opt-outs: document viewer and the differentials presentation workflow.
- **Result and detail views**: fixed bottom dock on phone (compact variant on submitted searches), sticky top from `sm` up.
- **Results routing**: each consolidated mode owns its submitted searches at `<mode>/search` (`/services/search` → `ServicesNavigatorPage`, `/forms/search` → `FormsSearchResultsPage`, `/differentials/search` → `DifferentialsHome` results view, `/formulation/search` → local mechanism results, and the same shape for dsm, dictionary, factsheets, specifiers, calculators, therapy-compass and documents). That split is not cosmetic: the bare path redirects to the shared home, so routing a submitted query back at it would loop — `consolidatedModeHomeModeIds` drives both halves from one list, and `tests/consolidated-mode-home-redirect.test.ts` pins the no-loop property. `/favourites` and `/tools` keep filtering in place on their own routes. `/sources` is the one consolidated mode whose bare path also forwards on a filter key alone (`?topic=`, `?band=`, and the rest of `consolidatedModeCatalogueFilterKeys`): a filter chip has no draft state, so requiring `run=1` for it would silently drop a shareable catalogue link on the home. Answer, Documents, and Prescribing submitted searches render inside `ClinicalDashboard` — intentional, since they need retrieval/answer state. Bare `/?mode=<id>` always renders the shared home with that mode preselected; only a submitted deep link (`q` plus `run=1`) resolves onward to the mode's own search surface.
- **Intentionally composer-free routes**: `/differentials/presentations/*` and `/differentials/compare` (comparison workflow owns its chrome), `/documents/[id]` viewer (has its own in-document ask composer), `/documents/source/*` (document flow owns mobile chrome). Do not re-flag these in search-consistency audits.
- **Shared in-page navigation**: `src/components/in-page-nav/` is the default template for section navigation on any mode page (`docs/search-chrome-behaviour.md`). `in-page-nav-header.tsx` (`InPageNavHeader`) owns the header row, both sheets and the `PhoneHeaderCollapsePortal` wrapper; `page-section-index.ts` (`PageSection`, `toDocumentSections`, `sectionTargetIds`) is the declaration shape; `use-resolved-page-sections.ts` narrows a declaration to the anchors actually rendered at this breakpoint; `use-in-page-section-nav.ts` composes that with `useDocumentSectionSpy` and `jumpToDocumentSection`; `use-page-section-weights.ts` measures segment weights; `use-in-page-chrome-metrics.ts` publishes `--inpage-anchor-offset`; `in-page-nav-classes.ts` holds the shared anchor (`inPageAnchor`) and actions-sheet row classes; `in-page-section-rail.tsx` (`InPageSectionRail`) is the optional visible second rail, opted into with `rail={{ label }}` by panel-swap routes with few sections (medications only) in place of the weighted track. The former sticky-chrome-metrics helper was retired from the Ward Flow line on 27 September 2026; this paragraph describes historical PsychSift navigation. Mounted by `dictionary/dictionary-term-page.tsx`, Dictionary topic detail in `dictionary/dictionary-catalogue-pages.tsx`, `differentials/differential-detail-page.tsx`, `services/service-detail-page.tsx`, `forms/form-detail-page.tsx`, `dsm/dsm-differential-considerations-page.tsx`, and — through a colocated `"use client"` nav-header sibling that owns and exports the route's section table — `specifiers/specifier-nav-header.tsx`, `formulation/formulation-nav-header.tsx`, `dsm/dsm-diagnosis-nav-header.tsx`, `factsheets/factsheet-nav-header.tsx` and `clinical-dashboard/medication-nav-header.tsx`. The sibling is mandatory for the four Server Component pages (neither `onSelectSection` nor a `LucideIcon` crosses the RSC boundary) and the convention for the rest. Two adopters swap panels instead of scrolling — `differential-detail-page.tsx` and the medication record page — so they pass explicit weights, carry no `inPageAnchor`, and use neither `useResolvedPageSections` nor the scroll spy. Every declared section is pinned against rendered DOM by `tests/in-page-nav-route-sections.dom.test.tsx` (anchors for the scrolling routes, swapped-in panels for the tab routes) and focused Dictionary DOM contracts.
- **Differentials diagnosis detail** (`/differentials/diagnoses/[slug]`): `differentials/differential-detail-page.tsx` owns the five tab panels; `detail-section-index.ts` is the one section table behind the tab rail, the header's section sheet and the weighted track. `diagnosis-map-panel.tsx` holds the map's layout and pan/zoom/pinch/keyboard engine, `diagnosis-map-insights.tsx` the comparison layer beneath it (selected diagnosis, exclude-first band, "tell them apart" rows), and `differential-overview-rail.tsx` the `lg+` Overview rail. The rail and the two-column Overview are desktop-only by design: the phone layout of this page is pinned by `tests/ui-tools.spec.ts`, and 150 of the 201 catalogue records carry no investigations, so every block renders only when it has content.
- **Shared secondary navigation**: `src/components/page-secondary-navigation.tsx` (`PageSecondaryNavigation`, mode destinations only). Mode destinations come from `src/lib/mode-secondary-navigation.ts` (`modeSecondaryNavigationRegistry`, no "Home" item). `GlobalSearchShell` renders it in normal flow at the top of `#main-content` for its owned namespaced modes; it self-suppresses on clean mode homes, on Therapy Compass, and on every information page — `hasLocalInformationPageNavigation` is now just `isInformationPage`, because each of those routes owns its own in-page navigation. The older shared `SecondaryNavigation` component was deleted here (`/issues #271`): its `section` kind and "On this page" pill rail went when the last six information routes moved onto `InPageNavHeader`, and the surviving `route`/`action` kinds had no production constructor left — `RegistryModeNav` renders `ModeNav`, not `SecondaryNavigation`, so the only remaining caller was its own test file, which went with it.
- **Patient context (decision support)**: the app's patient-specific surface, spanning two engines over one session-scoped profile. Store: `src/lib/patient-profile-storage.ts` (sessionStorage external store, anonymous physiology + catalogue medication slugs, cleared on tab close and — via `clearPatientProfile` from the auth provider's account-transition boundary — on sign-out, session expiry and user change) behind `clinical-dashboard/patient-profile-context.tsx` (`PatientProfileProvider`, mounted for the whole shell). Engines: `src/lib/medication-patient-alerts.ts` (physiology — age/renal/hepatic/QTc/pregnancy/allergy, with an `unassessed` fail-safe) and `src/lib/medication-interactions.ts` (drug–drug, against the entered medication list). The interaction engine reads the generated `data/medication-interaction-index.json`, built by `scripts/build-medication-interaction-index.ts` (`npm run medications:interactions`, staleness-gated by `check:medication-interactions`) from the curated `src/lib/medication-interaction-lexicon.ts` — the catalogue's `Key Interactions` rows are prose, and that lexicon is what resolves their class/mechanism/non-drug terms to catalogue targets. `composeMedicationVerdict` folds both engines into the one tone a result row wears; **green is unreachable whenever either engine left something unassessed or unresolved**, degrading to a neutral "needs manual review" instead. UI: `clinical-dashboard/patient-profile-panel.tsx` (the form, including the medication picker), `medication-considerations.tsx` (both detail-page blocks and the verdict badge/edge helpers), and `patient-details-dock-action.tsx` (the phone dock pill — see the addon-slot section of `docs/search-chrome-behaviour.md`). Regulatory status is **open**: `docs/samd-classification-medication-considerations.md`.
- **Local filter fields** (sidebar "Search chats", document drawer "Find a document"/"Find a source PDF") are scoped filters, not global search; they share the `fieldControlWithIcon`/`fieldIcon` primitives.
- **Wiring conventions** for buttons and route navigation (and the gates that enforce them — the dead-button ESLint rule and the orphan-route reachability test) live in `docs/wiring-conventions.md`.
