# Every Ward Flow document, and which branch carries it

**Generated mechanically from git, 2026-08-30 — regenerated after the Verifier branch was folded
and the safety checklist was written. ⚠️ The previous version said 125 documents across FIVE
branches and named a session by a name the owner had already changed. There are SIX branches.**

**137 distinct ward documents across 6 branches.** ⚠️ **Re-measured 2026-08-31 before the fold; was 130 on 08-30.**

## ⚠️ The 24 documents on ONE branch only — re-measured 2026-08-31 (was 16)

⚠️ **11 on `Ward-design`, 13 on `Wardquestions`. ALL 24 are in the fold manifest's copy list**
(`docs/ward-flow-fold-manifest-2026-08-31.md`), which is itself one of the 24.
✅ **Nine of Ward-design's eleven are DESIGN SPECS that exist nowhere else, including the community
hub — which has a written specification and no code.**

### The list as it stood on 08-30

**These cannot be read from the working line. They go with their branch, and if that worktree is
lost they are recoverable only from the backup.** ⚠️ **A worktree on this machine has been deleted
mid-session twice.**
