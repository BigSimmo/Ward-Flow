# Ward Flow — what it is, and what it deliberately does not do

**Draft, 2026-08-29.** The mission statement below is written for the owner to correct, not to be
adopted as written. The refusal register beneath it is a reorganisation of decisions he has already
made — no refusal here is new, and none has been strengthened or weakened in the move.

**Why this exists now.** The owner has a route into the Western Australian health service's
psychiatric bed flow, and the three-month goal is a completed, functional demonstration on mock data.
Both facts change what these documents have to be. A health service reading this needs to know which
constraints are safety commitments that would survive into a real system, and which are true only
because this is a prototype. Mixed together, they will either build something the owner would object
to, or leave out something he always intended.

## Mission statement — APPROVED FRAME, 2026-08-29

The owner chose the argument (the current state, stated plainly) and the register: **"working
demonstration, but prototype flexibility"** — take it seriously, and nothing in it is settled.

> **There is no system. There is a telephone, an inbox, and goodwill.**
>
> A patient waits in an emergency department while referrals go out by email. Wards answer one at a
> time, or not at all. Nobody can see where anyone is, how long they have waited, or which beds are
> about to come free. Each service makes its own plan and none of them can see the others. The
> patient sits, the department fills, and the delay belongs to nobody.
>
> **Ward Flow is a working demonstration of what could replace it** — a statewide hub for psychiatric
> bed flow in Western Australia. **Its one job is getting a person from an emergency department to a
> ward.** It follows them from a community team's decision to admit, through the department, to the
> ward, and out again through discharge — giving every role along that path one shared picture
> instead of an inbox, because the wait belongs to all of them and the picture belongs to none.
>
> **It runs, and nothing in it is settled.** Every rule it applies, every list it offers and every
> figure it shows is a proposal, recorded with the reasoning behind it so it can be argued with and
> changed. It is built to be told it is wrong.
>
> It runs on synthetic data, holds no patient information, and is not clinical decision support. It
> decides nothing and recommends nobody. It shows what people have entered, and when.

**The one-line version**, for an email or an introduction:

> _A working demonstration of a statewide hub for psychiatric bed flow — following one person from the
> decision to admit through to their bed being free again, on entirely synthetic data. Nothing in it
> is settled._

### Why each paragraph is there, so nobody edits one out by accident

1. **The opening is the argument, and it is the owner's own.** _"There is a telephone, an inbox, and
   goodwill"_ does three things at once: it is concrete, it pre-empts the "we do have processes"
   pushback by naming what is actually there, and it is generous to the people doing the work — the
   failure is the absence of a system, not the absence of effort. It ends on _"the delay belongs to
   nobody"_, which makes the accountability point without accusing anyone. That is the sentence
   people will repeat back to you.
2. **The second names the job and then the pathway, in that order.** "Its one job is getting a person
   from an emergency department to a ward" is the owner's foundation stated in the mission itself,
   and it must not be edited out for concision — without it the paragraph describes a system without
   saying what it is _for_, and a reader supplies their own answer. The rest of the pathway follows so
   nobody reads it as an emergency-department tool or a ward tool.
3. **The third is the flexibility clause and it is load-bearing.** "Working demonstration" invites a
   health service to take it seriously; without this paragraph it also invites them to treat the
   decisions inside as fixed. Every one is provisional and recorded with its reasoning. Removing this
   paragraph turns an open proposal into a finished product nobody agreed to.
4. **The fourth is the governance boundary** and appears on the screens too, not only here.

### Two lines deliberately NOT included, and why

- **"Wards pick and choose patients."** Probably true, and the one line that loses the room, because
  a ward representative will be in it. The honest version, if the point must be made:
  _"a ward answering an email cannot see what else is being asked of the network."_ Same fact, and it
  blames the absence of information rather than the people — which is also the actual cause.
- **Any figure for how long patients wait, how many beds are blocked, or what any of it costs.** No
  such figure exists that this project can source, and an invented one is how a demonstration gets
  quoted in a meeting and then disbelieved.

## The foundation

**Owner, 2026-08-29:** _the core principle is patient flow from the emergency department to the
wards. That is the foundation. Everything is built on it._

Every refusal, every principle and every scope decision below is subordinate to that. Where any of
them would obstruct a person getting from an emergency department to a ward, or obstruct someone
seeing why that is not happening, the refusal is the thing to re-examine — not the flow.

Discharge is in scope because it is what makes the forward flow **repeatable**, not because it is a
second subject: someone leaves, a bed appears, the next person moves into it. A demonstration in
which the bed never comes back can only ever show one patient moving once.

## The refusals, split three ways

The owner's instruction, 2026-08-29: _"be careful about refusals and don't take them as law."_ So each
entry below records **how firmly it is held** and **what reversing it would cost** — because a
refusal with no reason attached gets reversed by the next person who finds it inconvenient, and a
refusal treated as scripture stops the project from learning.

### A. Principles — these should survive into any real system

Safety, privacy and honesty commitments. A team building from this blueprint should treat these as
the design, not as prototype limitations.

### B. Prototype scope — true only because this is a prototype

them as "not yet", never as "never".

| **The prototype is reachable only through a developer gate**          | Yes                                                                                                      |
| **The wards, bed numbers and travel times are invented**              | Yes — and this one needs confirming with the real network before any demonstration to people who know it |
| **Accepting a referral creates no movement and arranges no transfer** | Almost certainly. It was a deliberate seam while the two halves were built separately                    |

### C. Open design choices — the owner's preference today, cheap to revisit

Recorded so nobody treats them as settled law, and so nobody reverses them by accident either.

## What the route into a real health service changes

The owner has a possible adopter, and it is the actual WA psychiatric bed-flow service. Three
consequences follow, and none of them is optional:

1. **The invented network becomes the biggest credibility risk in the project.** People in that
   service know the real wards, the real bed numbers, and the real travel times. A wrong number they
   recognise costs the room in seconds, and no amount of correct design recovers it. Every screen
   showing network data must say on its face that the network is synthetic — not only a document.
   One example already loaded in the fixture: a Perth Metropolitan person recorded as reachable from
   Armadale only by air.
2. **The unvalidated bed model stops being a design risk and becomes a demonstration risk.** Eight
   phases rest on `predicted → confirmed → released`, and no ward clinician has read it. Showing that
   model to the service that would adopt it, before one of its own clinicians has checked it, is the
   most expensive possible order to do this in.
3. **"Not clinical decision support" has to be said on the screens, not just in the repository.** It
   already is in places. It needs to be everywhere a figure could be mistaken for advice.

## The concrete shape of "conservative failure everywhere" — not a new principle

**This is Group A's conservative-failure row above, made concrete. It is deliberately NOT a new
rule with a new number**, and the reason is itself the finding: three sessions rediscovered it today
because the row stated it abstractly, and the ledger session caught me about to mint a fresh
namespace for a principle the project already held.

**And the row's old wording is why it was rediscoverable.** It said an unresolvable record _"renders
as absent"_ — which reads two ways. _Shown, and marked absent_ is the rule. _Disappears from the
screen_ is the bug. **The sentence licensed the failure it was written to prevent**, and I have
sharpened it above rather than adding a rule beside it.

**The concrete form:** when a screen cannot place, match or resolve an item, it **shows the item and
says it could not be placed.** It never omits it, and never quietly substitutes a default.

**Three sessions built it independently on the same day**, none having read the others: the ward board's tile framing, the ward index's _"not placed in a health
service"_ group, and the flow diagram's `unplacedUnits` computed at `flow-diagram.tsx:188` and
rendered as an explicit anomaly at `:433`. A fourth instance is being built for the sixth-service
hole. **Three independent inventions of one rule is a rule that wants writing down once.**

**The rule:** when a screen cannot place, match or resolve an item, it **shows the item and says it
could not be placed.** It never omits it, and it never quietly substitutes a default.

**Why the concrete form is worth the words, when the abstract one already existed.** The mission says this system
_"shows what people have entered, and when"_ and that it _"decides nothing and recommends nobody"_.
**An item that vanishes because the software could not place it is the system deciding something** —
that this person or bed does not count — and hiding the decision in the same motion. It is the
mission's failure mode expressed in a layout.

**And it is the governing failure mode of this whole project in visual form:** an absent signal reads
exactly like a passing one. A ward that is not on the board looks identical to a ward with nothing to
report. **The anomaly is the signal.** Removing it does not remove the problem; it removes the only
evidence of it.

**Practical test for any new surface:** construct an item the surface cannot handle — a unit in no
health service, a referral matching no unit, a bed with no ward. **If it disappears, the surface is
wrong**, however correct its computation is for everything else.

## AMENDED — "No diagnosis" becomes "no diagnosis ABOUT A PERSON" (`FD-7`)

**In force.** The owner, asked directly about this rule: _"Yes I want you to update this rule since
it is required for referral."_ Recorded as `FD-7` in the ledger at `685955cae`.

**Provenance, stated because this refusal's own condition demands it** (_"needs a recorded decision,
not a drift"_): he said it to the ledger session, which asked the direct question and recorded his
words verbatim. **That is a recorded decision, not a drift** — the register of record holds it with
its wording. It did not reach me directly, and it is amended here on the ledger's authority rather
than mine. **If that is not what he meant, this is the entry to correct.**

**What is now permitted, and it is narrower than "diagnosis":** a single **ICD-10 F-chapter block
range** — `F20–F29 Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders`, `F30–F39 Mood (affective)
disorders`. **A block says what KIND of bed is needed. It is not a diagnosis about a person**, and
that distinction is the whole reason this is defensible rather than merely permitted.

**Most of it already exists**, found by running the owner's own check before writing this:
`TENTATIVE_DIAGNOSIS_BLOCKS` is live at `ward-admissions.ts:212`, eleven blocks, referenced across
eight files — and it was built to this standard already, its own comment reading _"a single value
picked from `TENTATIVE_DIAGNOSIS_BLOCKS`, never typed, never a specific condition, never anybody's
words"_, with the structural test _"widened in the SAME change as this field, by name, so the guard
bound on it rather than being stepped around."_ **Whoever chose block level over specific diagnoses
solved the hard part.**

**So the remaining work is EXTEND, not BUILD.** The referral record still forbids it —
`tests/ward-referral-model.test.ts:215` names `"diagnosis"` in its forbidden set.

### Four constraints, none of which may be dropped

1. **REUSE the existing block list. Never invent a second.** A second vocabulary for one fact is this
   project's named defect class, and a hand-written diagnosis list is the version it punishes hardest.
2. **Block level only.** A specific diagnosis is a clinical record about a person and is **not** what
   was approved.
3. **The referral's structural privacy allowlist is widened DELIBERATELY, by exactly one entry, in
   the same change.** That guard names `diagnosis` explicitly and exists to stop this field. It is
   authorised for this one and **must keep failing for every other — widened, never loosened.**
4. **Never free text, under any circumstances.** That breaches two rules at once and is not covered
   by this reversal.

### The seam — my judgement, since it is a plan question

**The referral carries the block at intake**, because the owner said _"required for referral"_ and
because the referrer is the person who has actually assessed the patient. **The admission inherits it
from the referral rather than asking again** — one place per fact, per
`docs/ward-flow-changeable-data-rule.md`. The existing seed authoring its own values is fine; that is
fixture data, not a live journey.

**But if the ward can revise it, that is NOT an edit — it is a second authored fact.** The referrer
thought `F30–F39`; the ward, having seen the person, thinks `F20–F29`. **Those are two assessments by
two people at two times, not one fact recorded twice**, and overwriting the first destroys the
referrer's account of what they were referring for. If revision is wanted, it is a new entry with its
own author and timestamp, and both stay visible. **Not decided — flagged, because the tempting
implementation is an editable field, and that is the one that silently loses evidence.**

### Still open, and he has not answered it

A referral in practice says _"first-episode psychosis"_ or _"relapse of bipolar"_ — a presentation,
not a chapter heading. If that is what he wants, the list should be shorter and more clinical than
the coding standard. **The likeliest revision, and open.**

### The original condition, kept for the record

_"Owner decision. Costs one field; needs a recorded decision, not a drift."_

**The vocabulary’s footing:** published ICD-10 F-chapter block ranges, carried with their codes, sit
in the **authored-elsewhere** category of `docs/ward-flow-changeable-data-rule.md` — real,
attributable, and not invented here.

## The referral record rule — replaces "exactly five person-facts" (owner, 2026-08-30)

**Owner:** _"Overhaul the five facts rule… that was an old early rule. Update it to ensure it aligns
with current referral requirement which will likely have future additions added."_

### Why the old rule broke, and it is the reusable part

**"A referral carries exactly five person-facts. Nothing else, ever."** That rule **counted**. A count
is checkable and it is brittle: the moment the thing legitimately grows, the rule is either broken or
abandoned, and there is no third option. It broke tonight against a sheet the owner himself asked
for.

**The replacement TYPES rather than counts.** It constrains what **kind** of field may exist, not how
many. **A count breaks when the thing grows; a type survives growth** — which is exactly what he
asked for, since more fields are expected.

### The rule

1. **Every field is a chosen option from a fixed list.** No typed values, no numbers entered by hand,
   no dates. This is the property that makes the privacy claim **checkable rather than promised**, and
   it is why a longer list of fields costs nothing.
2. **Exactly one story field.** Clearly labelled, optional, and last. **It never feeds eligibility,
   matching, ranking or ordering** — enforced across the transitive import graph, the way
   `ward-referrals.ts` is already forbidden from importing `ward-derivations`, not by a comment
   asking nicely.
3. **Never, in any field:** a name, a date of birth, an address, a record number, or any free-typed
   value outside the story field. **This clause governs the REFERRAL SHEET and is unchanged by
   `PD-1`.** That ruling opened identity on the `Patient` record and deliberately did not open it
   here — a referral REFERENCES a patient, and a reference is not a copy. If this clause ever reads
   as contradicting the amended row in the refusal register above, it does not: they govern
   different records, and keeping them different is the entire mechanism.
4. **Fields may determine which beds are ELIGIBLE. Nothing on the sheet may rank a person or
   recommend one.** See the correction below — this is the clause I got wrong once.
5. **A new field is allowed when it satisfies 1–4 and is recorded as a decision.** Growth is expected
   and is not a breach. **Adding a field silently is.**

   **Clause 5 is the only clause with no mechanical enforcement, which makes it the one that decays
   first** — the build session’s observation, and it is right. **Half of it is already enforced and
   half is not:** the structural privacy test pins the exact field set, so an added field turns it
   red and the addition cannot be silent in the code. **Nothing whatsoever catches the missing
   decision record.**

   **The cheap enforcement: every entry in that allowlist carries the decision id that authorised
   it.** `"tentativeDiagnosisBlock", // FD-7`. Then a bare entry is **visibly wrong at the point of
   change**, to a reader and to a check, and "record the decision" stops being a discipline someone
   has to remember at the moment they are busy widening a guard. **It also makes the guard readable
   backwards** — every field on the record can be traced to the decision that put it there, which is
   the property the ledger exists to provide and currently cannot for fields.

   **And the id must be CHECKED TO RESOLVE, or the mechanism is this project's own defect class
   installed at the site built to prevent it.** An unchecked id beside an entry is a comment: the
   next person widening a guard — at the worst possible moment, which is exactly when this happens —
   writes `// FD-9` because it looks like the others, and **every assertion stays green.** Five of
   this branch's thirteen instances of that class were found at precisely such a mechanism.

   **So the check asserts every id in the allowlist resolves to a real decision record, and it is
   mutation-proved** — put an invented id in, watch it go red, restore. **An id that is only a
   comment is a promise wearing the costume of a reference.**

   **This is also what gives clause 5 a way to fail.** As written, _"adding one silently is the
   breach"_ describes a breach nothing can detect. With the ids checked, **silent addition stops
   being a discipline anyone has to remember and becomes impossible to commit.**

### The correction I owe, because he approved my wording

I told him the replacement should mean _"nothing on the sheet ever influencing which bed a patient
gets"_, and **he said yes to it. That sentence is wrong**, and building to it would break the system.

**Age band, secure-bed-needed, involuntary-bed-needed and the rest exist precisely to determine which
beds can take this person.** That is eligibility, it is the point of the sheet, and it already works.

**The real distinction is between eligibility and judgement.** Eligibility is a fact about beds —
_this unit can hold someone involuntarily, that one cannot_. A ranking is a claim about a person.
**The refusal has always been on the second**, and clause 4 now says so in those terms. **The story
field is separately barred from both**, because prose cannot be checked at all.

**Recorded rather than quietly fixed: he approved a sentence of mine that was wrong, and an approved
error is harder to catch than an unapproved one** — nobody re-reads a settled question.

### What is unchanged

**No free-typed value outside the story field. No name, no date of birth, no address. No figure,
timeframe or threshold from the Mental Health Act, anywhere, including in a hint or a placeholder.
Nothing that predicts, scores or ranks a person.** The story field is an addition to what a referral
may carry, **not a loosening of any of those.**

## The real hospital names stay, and the figures beside them carry the warning

**Owner decision, 2026-08-30.** Cited by name rather than numbered, because it is a statement about
what this demonstration IS rather than a decision that could be reversed without changing that.

**Recognition is the point.** A clinician in Western Australia reads the network instantly because
they know those hospitals. **Invented names would make it a diagram of nowhere** — a demonstration
that cannot be checked against the reader's own knowledge, which is most of what makes it persuasive
to the people who would have to adopt it.

**The risk was never the name. It is somebody believing the FIGURES beside it.** Every bed count,
every travel time, every occupancy on this system is invented. **A real hospital name lends those
numbers a credibility they have not earned**, and that is the actual hazard.

**So the marker goes in the HEADING of any screen showing site-level figures, never in a footer.**
A footer is read after the number has already been believed. **The precedent already exists in the
guided tour, where every beat says it is synthetic** — that is the standard to match, not a single
badge somewhere on the page.

**The test:** a reader who looks only at the top of the screen and one number must still know the
number is invented. If the marker only reaches someone who reads to the bottom, it is decoration.

## `FD-10` — a ward may add its own tentative diagnosis block, and never overwrites the referrer's

**Owner decision, 2026-08-30**, confirming the seam recorded above.

**Both stay visible, each with its own role and time.** The referrer thought one thing; the ward,
having seen the person, may think another. **Those are two assessments by two clinicians at two
moments, not one fact recorded twice** — and overwriting the first erases what the referral was
actually for, which on this system is evidence rather than housekeeping.

**It is a CORRECTION, not a task.** No prompt, nothing daily, nothing on anybody's list. The friction
constraint applies directly: a system that asks a ward to confirm a diagnosis every day has invented
work, and invented work is what makes people stop reading the screen.

**The warning stays in the row, because the tempting implementation is the wrong one:** an editable
field is the obvious build and it is **the one that silently loses the earlier record.** Nothing goes
red when it does.
