# Ward Flow scripts inventory

Curated map of `scripts/` (139 files) and the `package.json` script surface (113 entries),
with a maintained generated count header and a historical catalogue below. The current
command surface is `package.json`. `npm run docs:check-inventory` checks the declared counts
with the existing tolerance; `npm run docs:check-scripts` checks maintained command references,
excluding marked historical sections. Neither check establishes semantic freshness.

<!-- docs-script-refs:historical-start -->

## Historical scripts catalogue

The preserved catalogue was grouped by purpose and is not an exhaustive current per-file listing.
Every top-level `.mjs`/`.ts`/`.cjs` script is named below (the 44 the 2026-09-02 audit found
uncatalogued were added the same day, in "Also catalogued" lists per section); the remaining files
are fixtures, SQL, subfolder helpers, and small shared helpers grouped rather than itemised.

> The two counts in the sentence above are generated facts, not prose. Keep them in the exact
> `(N files)` / `(N entries)` shape — tooling rewrites that sentence by regex.

Legend: **[live]** routine tooling · **[infra]** runner/guard plumbing · **[one-shot]** completed
migration/batch helper that is a candidate for an `archive/` subfolder under `scripts/` once its
migration has shipped (see `docs/maturity-backlog-workorders.md` L1).

`verify:cheap:internal` chain also runs in CI's `static-pr` job, so the two lists can't drift.

Also in the gate set: `check-assets.mjs`,
`check-hosted-migration-role.mjs` (`check:migration-role` — pins the immutable applied migration and
the `postgres` role), `check-edge-functions.mjs`, `check-ci-env.mjs`,
`run-gitleaks-pinned.mjs`, `rag-offline-contract.mjs` + `test-rag-offline.mjs` (offline RAG
contract), `check-lighthouse-budget.mjs`, `measure-cls-attribution.mjs`
(ledger `#147` — names the elements behind a CLS breach, which Lighthouse's own
`layout-shift-elements` audit did not; CLS reproduces offline, LCP does not), and the workflow-contract
guards `check-pr-policy-workflow.mjs` and `check-codex-autofix-workflow.mjs`.
`audit-formatting-fixtures.ts` checks the formatting fixtures themselves.
`setup-codex-cloud.sh`, `maintain-codex-cloud.sh`, and
`install-codex-cloud-command-shims.sh` reproduce the provider-free Cloud runtime documented in
`docs/codex-cloud.md`; `npm run check:codex-cloud` verifies that
the runtime pins, install commands, offline defaults, and documentation stay aligned.
Programme execution helpers (no retrieval/ranking behaviour change): `rag-phase-launch-check.mjs`,
`rag-task-brief.mjs`, `check-rag-phase-receipts.mjs`, and `build-rag-plan-packages.mjs`.

Also catalogued (2026-09-02), gate and CI helpers:

- `check-clinical-hazard-controls.mjs` (`check:clinical-hazard-controls`) — validates `docs/clinical-hazard-controls.json`: hazards H1–H6 present, every control state one of the four allowed values, the two named decision records present and dated.
- `check-coverage-inventory.mjs` (`check:coverage-inventory`) + `coverage-contract.mjs` — the post-run LCOV guard that every file in the shared coverage include globs appears in the report, and the shared contract Vitest reads the same globs from.
- `check-dead-code-candidate.mjs` (`check:dead-code-candidate`) — refuses to call a symbol dead on "nothing imports it" (unchecked plan boxes, fixtures, dynamic references); see `docs/agents/dead-code-deletion.md`.
- `check-diff-integrity.mjs` (`check:diff-integrity`) — refuses a diff that silently destroys committed content (test-case floors, truncation artefacts; written after `#Y30AXB`); see `docs/agents/test-deletion-guard.md`.
- `check-mockup-retirement.mjs` (`check:mockups`) — makes the written record in `mockups/README.md`, not a reachability scan, the gate on retiring a mockup.
- `check-repo-awareness-snapshot.ts` (`check:repo-awareness-snapshot`) + `generate-repo-awareness-snapshot.ts` (`snapshot:repo-awareness`) — `data/repo-awareness-snapshot.json` (routes, documentation catalogue coverage, review state) freshness and generation.
- `check-privacy-readiness.mjs` (`check:privacy-readiness`, `check:privacy-readiness:release`) — validates `docs/governance/privacy-readiness.v1.json` required ids and release-blocking states.
- `check-source-catalogue.ts` (`check:source-catalogue`) — repository source references, providers and coverage issues from `src/lib/sources/repository-providers`.
- `check-stale-docs.mjs` (`check:stale-docs`) — advisory report of Markdown docs untouched for `--days` and linked from nowhere; refuses shallow clones.
- `check-playwright-browser-revision.mjs` (`check:playwright-browser-revision`) — fails closed unless the pinned Chromium revision has a launchable binary on disk (`#312`).
- `playwright-pr-shards.mjs` (`check:playwright-pr-shards`) — duration-aware shard groups for the required Chromium PR journeys.
- `browser-test-plan.mjs` (`plan:browser`, `check:browser-test-plan`) — chooses the smallest browser gate that still covers a change.
- `classify-visual-baseline-outcome.mjs` — decides whether a failed `test:e2e:visual` run was pixel drift (advisory) or an infrastructure failure that stays red.
- `lighthouse-measurement-outcome.mjs`, `lighthouse-time-budget.mjs`, `live-web-vitals-inputs.mjs` — Lighthouse budget runner helpers: whether a cell produced gradeable evidence, bounded-stage timing, and validation of the dispatch-only live Web Vitals matrix.
- `check-image-content-contract.mjs`, `trivy-image-scan.mjs`, `resolve-oci-image-digest.mjs`, `app-container-smoke.mjs` (`smoke:app-container`) — container CI: final-image hardening assertions, pinned Trivy scan + SBOM, multi-platform digest lookup for pinning base images, and a provider-free boot smoke of the built app image.
- `check-worker-python-lock.mjs` (`check:worker-python-lock`, `check:worker-python-cloud-lock`, `check:worker-python-locks:static`), `generate-worker-python-lock.mjs` (`generate:worker-python-lock`, `generate:worker-python-cloud-lock`), `worker-python-lock-config.mjs` — the hashed `worker/python/requirements.txt` lock targets.
- `check-dev-drive-cache.mjs` (`check:dev-drive-cache`) — Windows Dev Drive npm cache registration and Defender trust (`#6SMMB4`).

Also catalogued (2026-09-04):

- `check-dependency-drift.mjs` (`check:dependency-drift`) — flags a surface whose transitive import closure changed even though the files a staleness check names directly did not.
- `check-design-drift-ratchet.mjs` (`check:design-drift-ratchet`) — ratchet guard for two design-token drift metrics (bypass-prone inline `style={{ }}` under `src/**`; design-system components with zero product importers).
- `stamp-service-worker.mjs` (part of `build:internal`) — gives `public/sw.js` a different body on every build so the browser's byte comparison detects an update and fires `updatefound`/`activate`.

use `verify:phone-chrome` before the broad UI gate. It checks installed-lock parity, then selects focused contracts and Playwright owners from the changed paths; shared foundations add `verify:ui` last. Documentation-only scopes run only documentation guards. `audit:final-merge` is local-only unless both `--providers` and `ALLOW_PROVIDER_READS=true` are supplied.

database files on 26 September 2026.

Also catalogued (2026-09-02): `build-medication-interaction-index.ts` (`medications:interactions` /
`check:medication-interactions` — builds `data/medication-interaction-index.json` from the catalogue
snapshot and the curated lexicon), `build-medication-lexicon-report.ts` (`medications:lexicon-report` /

`docs/medication-interaction-lexicon-review.md`), `probe-corpus-image-encodings.mjs` (reports image
encoding / stream-filter patterns across the corpus PDFs), and `inspect-shadow-extraction.ts` (reads the

(trend across runs), `eval-utils.ts` (shared harness helpers),
`probe-generation-quality.ts` (one approved cache-bypassed live answer; reports the structured
`generation_quality_gate_reasons` added for `/issues` `#231` — provider-backed, refuses demo mode),
`check-rag-adversarial-fixtures.mjs` + `rag-adversarial-contract.mjs` (offline, network-free
validation of the synthetic adversarial fixture dataset and its baseline record; separate from
`check-rag-fixtures.mjs`, which is untouched),
`eval-rag-adversarial-offline.mjs` (packet B2: fixture validation then the offline Vitest
adversarial harness `tests/rag-adversarial-harness.test.ts`; `npm run eval:rag:adversarial:offline`,
routed by `ci-change-scope.mjs` to RAG-surface PRs only; fails closed on missing fixture,
network attempt, or round-trip budget breach),
`blind-answer-pairs.ts` (Gate E offline blinded A/B pairing over two
`eval-answer-quality --dump-answers` artefacts — `build` emits reading-pack/verdict-sheet/
assignment-key under `output/` or `.local/` only, `unblind` resolves recorded verdicts back to
version labels; pure file transformation, no provider access, node-builtin imports only;
`/issues` `#E0N0QC`; run via `node scripts/run-tsx.mjs scripts/blind-answer-pairs.ts`).
Golden fixtures:

itself is dispatch-only (`.github/workflows/docling-lab.yml`). See `eval/docling/README.md`.

## Registry / catalogue content [live]

`seed-registry-records.ts`, `embed-registry-records.ts`, `reconcile-registry-governance.ts`,
`import-services-export.ts`, `import-differentials-export.ts`, `seed-differential-records.ts`,
`import-medications-export.ts`, `seed-medication-records.ts`, `review-therapy.mjs`
(`therapy:review` — report-only by default; qualified-clinician, interactive-TTY sign-off only;
source and generated bytes roll back together on failure unless a concurrent source edit must be
preserved, in which case generated assets return to their exact pre-review state and the CLI fails).
Also catalogued (2026-09-02): `build-mha-act-sections.mjs` (`check:mha-act-sections` — extracts and
curates the plain-English Mental Health Act 2014 (WA) section summaries the Forms mode cites).

## Build & assets [live/infra]

`build-worker.mjs`, `build-analyze.mjs`, `build-therapies-index.mjs`,
`build-cross-mode-differentials-index.mjs`, `build-ranking-snapshot.ts`,
`build-forms-pdf-manifest.mjs` (`check:forms-pdf-manifest` — derives each committed WA MHA form
PDF's sha256, size, and whether opening it needs a user password; offline, fails closed),
`generate-site-map.ts`, `generate-brand-assets.ts`, `generate-sample-documents.ts`,
`check-sample-extraction.ts`, `optimize-public-images.mjs`.
Also catalogued (2026-09-02): `generate-gates-figures.mjs` (`design-system:gates-figures:update`;
part of `check:design-system-contract` — the ratchet-figures block in `docs/design-system/GATES.md`) and
`token-layer-divergences.mjs` (`design-system:token-divergence:update`; part of
`check:design-system-contract` — the v1/v2 token-layer divergence contract).

`set-site-administrator.ts`, `ops-digest.mjs`, `build-clinical-review-queue.ts`,
`verify-locality-metadata.ts`, `update-docs-inventory.mjs`.
Also catalogued (2026-09-04), landed without `package.json` wiring yet: `check-ward-data.mjs` —
reads the Ward Flow prototype's changeable data (bed numbers, hospitals, wards) and reports
arithmetic that does not add up, in plain words aimed at a non-programmer editor; read-only and
offline. `run-ward-tests.mjs` — runs a named set of Vitest files and refuses to report success
unless every file handed in actually produced a result, closing a false-green mode where a crashed
worker still prints an internally consistent pass count.

### Review ledger, branches and skills [live]

The branch-review-ledger tooling (`branch-review-ledger.mjs`, `merge-branch-review-ledger.mjs`,
`generate-branch-review-index.mjs`) and the outstanding-issues ledger tooling (`ledger-inbox.mjs`,
`issue-id.mjs`, `issues-report.mjs`) were retired on the Ward Flow line on 26 September 2026 at
Josh's request; the PsychSift versions remain on `origin/main`.

- `sync-open-pr-branches.mjs` (`sync:pr-branches`), `sync-pr-branches.mjs` (compatibility entry point) — anti-churn sync for stale open PR heads;
  refuses a missing or bot `gh` identity. `sweep-merged-branches.mjs` — merged-branch sweep.
- `reconciliation-preflight.mjs`, `reconciliation-evidence-pack.mjs` — broad chat/worktree
  reconciliation entry point and its evidence bundle; see `docs/reconciliation-playbook.md`.
- `list-database-skills.mjs` (`skills` / `check:skills`), `sync-skills.mjs`, `skill-create.mjs` —
  the `.agents/skills/` catalogue.
- Also catalogued (2026-09-02): `setup-codex-worktree.mjs` (`setup:codex-worktree` —
  one isolated exact-lock worktree for sweeps); `worktree-cleanup.mjs` (safe orphan-worktree
  pruning and reporting, `#6GW95D`); `retryable-fs.mjs` (Windows-safe recursive removal retries
  shared by the worktree tools); `diagnose-codex-cloud.mjs` (`diagnose:codex-cloud`);
  `rebuild-caring-contacts-sdd-workspace.mjs` (rebuilds the disposable `.superpowers/sdd/`
  workspace for the Caring Contacts plans from the tracked records).

### Live/staging verification [live]

`soak-test.ts`, `test-cross-tenant-staging.ts` (the executable owner-boundary proof behind
`docs/staging-tenancy-release-evidence.md`), `deployment-boot-smoke.mjs`, `run-live-tests.mjs`.
These reach live providers — they need explicit confirmation before running.

### Browser and performance capture [infra]

`playwright-base-url.ts`, `classify-playwright-failures.mjs`, `capture-chrome-parity.ts`,
`summarise-web-vitals.mjs`.

## One-shot / dated — archive candidates [one-shot]

Completed migration/batch helpers kept only for provenance; retire to the `scripts/archive/`
subfolder once the underlying migration is confirmed live (work order L1).

**Already archived** (in `scripts/archive/`, still runnable): `check-m13-migration.ts` /
`check-july8-live-batch.ts` — live-DB re-verification probes via `npm run check:m13-migration` /
`npm run check:july8-live-batch`. Their `.test.ts` companion lives in `scripts/archive/` too so it
stays out of the `tests/**` run. `backfill-document-tags.ts` / `backfill-enrichment.ts` — completed
one-time backfills, still invocable via `npm run tags:backfill` / `npm run enrich:backfill` (both
repointed at the archive path). `backfill-document-covers.mjs` — completed one-time backfill for
documents indexed before the ingestion pipeline started generating cover thumbnails directly (see
`worker/main.ts`, `worker/python/extract_pdf_assets.py`); no npm script, invoke directly via
`node scripts/archive/backfill-document-covers.mjs`. `tests/document-cover-thumbnails.test.ts`
still asserts its pagination logic by reading the archived source (`ledger #194`, 2026-08-14).

Ledger `#194` also named `backfill-gold-document-labels.ts` and `backfill-smart-index.ts` as
one-shot candidates, but both are already classified as `[live]` ongoing tooling elsewhere in this
doc (Document intelligence & governance / Ingestion, indexing & reindex) and in
`docs/codebase-index.md` — not completed migrations. Left in `scripts/` on that basis; re-flag only
if their live classification is deliberately revisited.

**Remaining candidates** (still in `scripts/`, retire once each is confirmed retired):
`check-retrieval-owner-migration.ts`, `backfill-source-metadata.ts`, `backfill-text-normalization.ts`,
`backfill-visual-intelligence.ts`, `derive-unknown-status.ts`, `reindex-image-generation-metadata.ts`,
`measure-wrapped-dose-prevalence.ts`, `decompose-indexing-v3.mjs`, `repro-coalesce-poison-race.mjs`
(a one-off race reproducer).

## Workflow planners [infra]

`external-workflow.mjs` (`workflow:run/status/verify/deps/clean-state/export/handoff`) and
`productivity-workflow.mjs` (`workflow:flightplan/triage/clinical-proof/design-sweep/rag-lab/
operator-closeout/lifecycle`) — see `docs/productivity-workflows.md`.
