# The PR-babysit budget is enforced for Claude Code only — a documented gap

**Status:** gap documentation only — this document builds no mechanism
**Ledger row:** `#258` (P2, rec)
**Checked:** 2026-08-14 against `origin/main` at `d47aa6d`; rule reshaped from a ban to a budget 2026-08-19
**Rule it backs:** `AGENTS.md` → "Babysit the pull request, then stop"

A session should babysit its own pull request for a while — a check that goes red a minute
after the PR opens is cheapest to fix right then. What costs is the _unbounded_ tail: a session
that stays attached indefinitely, polling `gh pr checks`, re-running failed jobs, re-syncing the
branch, answering review bots, or parking a wake-up on it. Claude Code on the web is the worst
case, because the cloud session keeps running and nothing naturally ends the loop.

The rule is therefore a **30-minute budget** measured from the moment the PR URL comes back:
inside it, following the PR is ordinary work; past it, the follow tools are denied and the
session reports where CI stands and stops. PR #1649 built the enforcement, and 2026-08-19
reshaped it from a blanket ban into that budget. **Only one of the three agents this repo
supports gets the hook.** This document records where the
enforcement lives, what the other two actually have, and what parity would require — so the
gap is a known limit rather than an open task that looks unstarted.

## 1. What Claude Code has

`.claude/hooks/pr-handoff-stop.sh`, registered in `.claude/settings.json` as two matchers:

| Phase         | Matcher                                                                                                                                                                                             | Effect                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PostToolUse` | `Bash`, `PowerShell`, and any tool whose name matches `create_pull_request`                                                                                                                         | On a call that returns a real PR URL, drops a session-scoped marker stamped with the open time and tells the model the babysit budget has started. |
| `PreToolUse`  | `Bash`, `PowerShell`, `Monitor`, `ScheduleWakeup`, `CronCreate`, plus tool names matching `pull_request` / `workflow_(run\|job)` / `check_(run\|suite)` / `job_log` / `pr_status` / `update_branch` | While that marker exists and the budget is spent, denies the call with a reason naming the AGENTS.md rule.                                         |

Three deny classes, all gated on the budget being spent, which is the useful summary of what
"enforced" means here:

1. **Shell polling** — `gh pr checks|status|view|diff|list|comment|review`, `gh run watch|view|list|rerun|download`, `gh api …actions/runs|check-runs|check-suites|/pulls/`, and `sync:pr-branches`.
2. **GitHub MCP PR/CI tools**, matched by tool name, so a connector is not a way around the shell rule.
3. **Loop machinery** — `Monitor` and `ScheduleWakeup`, which is how a session parks itself on a PR without running a single command.

`CronCreate` is the one exception to the budget gating: it is denied from the moment the marker
lands, because a cron entry outlives the session and no later budget check could stop it.

Committing, pushing, ledger appends, and PR create/merge stay allowed throughout, as does every
class above while the budget lasts — `ScheduleWakeup` deliberately so, since waiting is how the
roughly five-minute cadence floor gets honoured and denying the wait only produces tight polling.

Details that matter to anyone reproducing this elsewhere:

- **The marker is session-scoped and durable**, at `<absolute-git-dir>/claude-pr-handoff-<session_id>`, falling back to `TMPDIR` outside a repo. Using the absolute git dir keeps it valid from any cwd and in linked worktrees.
- **The budget is measured from the marker's contents, never its mtime.** The file records `epoch=<seconds>` at PR-open time; an unreadable stamp, a marker written before the budget existed, or a clock that moved backwards all fail open rather than denying a whole session on a timestamp the hook never had. The ceiling is `CLAUDE_PR_BABYSIT_BUDGET_MINUTES` (default 30, clamped to 1..240, with any malformed value falling back to the default rather than removing the ceiling).
- **It fails open on a missing or unsafe `session_id`** (`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`), rather than sharing one marker across unrelated malformed payloads — path injection included.
- **Sibling sessions' markers are deliberately never pruned.** Post-mode runs on every shell call, so age-based deletion of other sessions' files would disarm a session still inside its own budget.
- **Post-mode scans only the request half of the payload**, never `tool_response`, so a command that merely _prints_ `gh pr create` and a PR URL cannot lock the session. Pre-mode deliberately scans the whole payload, because over-blocking is the safe direction there.
- **The escape hatch is explicit and user-driven**: prefix a shell command with `CLAUDE_ALLOW_PR_FOLLOW=1`, or delete the marker the deny reason names. A command that merely mentions a blocked token cannot self-authorise — the prefix must be at the start of the command.
- Sessions that never create a PR are untouched, so `Run PR` sweeps, `pr-ci-fix` work, and review sessions on someone else's PR still function.

## 2. What Codex and Cursor have

**The `AGENTS.md` prose, and nothing else.** Checked, rather than assumed:

- `.claude/settings.json` is read only by Claude Code. Its `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` registrations are invisible to the other two agents, so the marker is never dropped and no call is ever denied for them.
- `plugins/clinical-kb/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` declares `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `repository`, `keywords`, `skills` and an `interface` block. **There is no hook, event, or pre-tool-interception field**, and the plugin ships exactly one skill (`skills/clinical-kb-workflow/SKILL.md`). A Codex session reads guidance; nothing intercepts its tool calls.
- `.cursor/` contains `settings.json` (plugin enablement only — `context7-plugin`, `figma`), `mcp.json`, `agents/` and `skills/`. **No deny path.** The obsolete `pr-babysit.md` and `pr-bugbot.md` agents are retired by this change. Their removal does not add a mechanical PR-following limit for Cursor.

The consequence is precise, and it is worth stating plainly because it is easy to read the
hook's existence as though the problem were solved: **prose alone is what was already in force
before PR #1649, and it was already insufficient — that insufficiency is why the hook was
built.** The cost was not removed; it was relocated to whichever agent lacks the gate. A cloud
Codex session is the worst case, for the same reason Claude Code on the web was.

## 3. What a cross-agent mechanism would need

Any parity mechanism has to answer the same three questions the hook answers:

1. **Has this session already opened a PR?** Requires a durable, session-scoped marker written at the moment a PR-creating call returns a real PR URL — not at the moment one is attempted, since a failed create would otherwise end the session with no PR to hand over.
2. **Is this call one of the three deny classes, and is the budget spent?** Shell PR/CI polling, PR/CI tool calls by name, and loop machinery, each denied only once the budget has elapsed — plus cron, denied outright. Matching must cover the connector path as well as the shell, or the rule is trivially bypassed.
3. **Has the user explicitly asked to follow the PR anyway?** There must be an unlock, it must be user-driven, and a call must not be able to self-authorise by merely mentioning the unlock token.

Plus three properties the existing hook already got right and a second implementation would
have to match: fail open on an unidentifiable session; never prune a sibling session's marker;
and never let a tool's _output_ arm the marker.

**Cheapest first**, per `#258`'s own next step: check whether Codex or Cursor has since exposed
any pre-tool interception this repo can register — Codex plugin hooks under
`plugins/clinical-kb/`, Cursor rules or agent configuration under `.cursor/`. As of this
document, neither manifest exposes one.

**If no deny path exists**, the fallback the row proposes is a shared marker file plus a wrapper
that agents are instructed to route `gh` through. That is strictly weaker — it is advisory, an
agent can call `gh` directly, and it cannot touch the MCP-connector or loop-machinery classes at
all — but a wrapper can _log_, which makes a violation detectable after the fact rather than
invisible. Detection is not prevention, and a design that claims otherwise should be rejected.

## 4. Stop

- **Do not weaken the Claude Code hook to make the three agents symmetric.** Removing working enforcement to achieve uniformity trades a real control for the appearance of one.
- **Do not add a second copy of the deny list.** One script, multiple registrations. Two lists drift, and the drift is silent — the copy that falls behind still looks like enforcement.
- **Do not close `#258` on the strength of this document.** The gap is now recorded rather than open-and-unexamined, but it is still a gap: two of three agents remain prose-only. Re-check the Codex and Cursor manifests when either tool ships hook support, and close the row only when a mechanism exists or the limit is accepted deliberately.
