# The capacity screen — design

**Status:** design complete, nothing built. **Designed from Ward Verifier's browser report**
(`PROC-19`) — this page had not been touched since `3ab1f3dcc` on 26 August.

## The diagnosis, and it is unusually clean

> **"The fix is subtraction."**

**Six summary tiles, each repeating _"Across 23 synthetic units"_, in one eyeline. The full
disclaimer repeated on all 23 rows.**

⚠️ **The table is good and the honesty is right. It is drowning in itself.**

## The rule this page needs, and the warning that goes with it

**Say each thing once.**

🔴 **A design pass that removed the HONESTY instead of the REPETITION would be a real loss, and it is
the likelier outcome.** The disclaimer is the longest, dullest, most repeated text on the screen —
**it is exactly what a tidying pass deletes first, and whoever does it will believe they are
helping.**

**So the instruction is not "reduce the text". It is:**

| Keep                                                                       | Cut                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **That the units are synthetic** — once, where it governs everything below | **Its 23 repetitions**                   |
| **That the count spans 23 units** — once, at the top                       | **Its six repetitions across the tiles** |
| **The table** — it is doing its job                                        | —                                        |

⚠️ **The synthetic disclaimer moves to the header** (`HD-D1`), which exists precisely to carry the
one thing true on every screen. **It does not vanish; it stops being said 23 times on one page.**

## The bed-state row

**Six unlabelled digits under tiny headers.** ⚠️ **The same disease as the network diagram's ward
cards — a code the reader must memorise, with the key elsewhere.**

**And the same prescription: subtraction, not shrinking.** **Smaller labels would make it denser and
no more readable.** **Fewer numbers, each labelled where it sits.**

⚠️ **If six numbers are genuinely all needed, that is a finding about the screen's job rather than
its typography** — and it should be recorded as one, not solved with a legend.

## What must NOT happen

- 🔴 **The honesty does not go.** Restated because it is the whole risk on this page.
- **No invented threshold.** No "nearly full" band, no colour scale, no target occupancy — `P9-D3`.
  ⚠️ **A capacity screen is the single most natural place in the product for a red/amber/green
  ceiling, and there is no figure to build one from.**
- **No ranking of units.** `CO-Q1` refuses ranking a service; **a capacity table sorted by "worst"
  is that, with a neutral-sounding column header.**
- **No derived summary that outruns its source.** ⚠️ **The tiles read a number the ward capacity
  confirmation is the source of (`WF-D1`), so a tile is only as current as that form** — and
  **whether that confirmation can go stale is `WF-Q1`, still open.**

## Open, and not to be closed by building

- ⚠️ **Whether the six bed-state numbers are all needed.** **Not a typography question.**
- **Whether "23 synthetic units" is a figure or a fixture.** It is stated six times as though it
  were stable; ⚠️ **if a unit is ever added it becomes wrong in six places at once** — **one place
  per fact, and this page currently has six.**
