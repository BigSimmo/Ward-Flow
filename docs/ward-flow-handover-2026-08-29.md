# Ward Flow — cold-start handover, 2026-08-29

Everything a session with no memory of this work needs, in one page. Supersedes
`docs/ward-flow-handover-2026-08-28.md`, which described a single branch and is now wrong about the
most important thing: **there are two.**

§3 goes stale first — **check it against `git log` before acting on it.**

---

## 1. What this is

A **synthetic, offline prototype** of a psychiatric bed-flow hub for Western Australia, built for a
practising psychiatrist in Perth. It coordinates bed flow from a community team's decision to admit,
through the emergency department, to the ward, and out again through discharge.

It holds **no real patient data**, is reachable only through the administrator-gated developer hub at
`/mockups/ward-flow`, and is **not clinical decision support**. Its real output is a shared
understanding of what such a system would have to do — something to put in front of colleagues.

## 2. Where the work lives — TWO branches, deliberately

|                 | **Phase 8 — distance and the state**      | **The ward board**                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Worktree**    | `D:\Worktrees\Database\pr-2390-fix`       | `D:\Repos\Database\.claude\worktrees\nostalgic-vaughan-7ee231`       |
| **Branch**      | `claude/ward-flow-phases-6-7-design`      | `claude/ward-flow-ward-board`                                        |
| **`cd` prefix** | `cd /d/Worktrees/Database/pr-2390-fix &&` | `cd /d/Repos/Database/.claude/worktrees/nostalgic-vaughan-7ee231 &&` |
| **Holds**       | Phases 1–7 complete, Phase 8 in progress  | The ward board's calculation layer only — no screens yet             |

**Prefix every shell command with the `cd` for the branch you are on.** The working directory does
not reliably persist and silently reverts to a different checkout. An implementer lost an hour to
this, running its tests where its test file did not exist.

**Do not create a new worktree.** There are 221 and the machine is measurably degraded. The ward
board branch reuses an existing, already-installed folder.

**The ward board folds into Phase 8's branch when Phase 8 lands.** Phase 8 stays the main line —
owner's decision.

**THE MERGE WILL NOT BE CLEAN. This page said it would; that was false.** Verified with
`git merge-tree --write-tree` — **three add/add conflicts**:

```
CONFLICT (add/add): src/components/ward-management/ward-admissions.ts
CONFLICT (add/add): src/components/ward-management/ward-admissions-seed.ts
CONFLICT (add/add): tests/ward-admission-model.test.ts
```

**Why the safety rule did not catch it, which is the part worth keeping.** The rule was _"never edit
a file that exists on the other branch."_ Neither session edited one — **each created the same file
from scratch**, after the branches diverged, when Phase 8 cherry-picked the record. Git sees two
unrelated files sharing a name. **A rule about editing cannot catch two sessions creating.** It got
past the rule rather than through it.

**Resolution, agreed by all three sessions and binding: take the ward board's copy of all three
WHOLESALE, then repair Phase 8's test literals.** Never file by file, and never row by row.

**Why wholesale, tested the way that matters** — not "which is longer" but _"is there anything on the
Phase 8 side the ward board does not already have?"_ Answer: three seed rows in pre-confirmation
form, which this branch already carries in extended form. Nothing else.

**The single line most likely to be lost**, in the seed at `rph-adult-secure`:

```ts
["Female", "South West", 34, -2, { blockReason: "Awaiting accommodation", confirmedHoursAgo: 26 }],
```

The only seeded occupant that is **both confirmed and blocked**. Phase 8's row lacks
`confirmedHoursAgo`, so a hand merge takes the shorter one _because it looks like the common
ancestor_. Losing it removes a test **case**, not a test — **nothing goes red**, and a derivation that
dropped blocked releases from the confirmed count would then pass every test in this repository.

**RUNNING THE TESTS AFTER THIS MERGE VERIFIES NOTHING. Read this before resolving.**

`tests/ward-admission-model.test.ts` is one of the three conflicting files, and it holds the
**structural privacy allowlist** — the exact-equality assertion on the record's field set, the guard
that makes a future `notes`, `diagnosis`, `name` or `dob` field fail rather than be discouraged.
**So the guard that would catch a wrong resolution is itself inside the conflict.**

| Resolution                    | Record fields | Allowlist | Suite                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All three from the ward board | 28            | 28        | **green, and right**                                                                                             |
| All three from Phase 8        | 26            | 26        | **GREEN, AND WRONG** — `dischargeConfirmedAt` silently gone, and with it the only route to a `confirmed` release |
| Mixed                         | 28            | 26        | red                                                                                                              |

**The fully-wrong resolution passes. Only the half-wrong one fails.** A green suite after this merge
is consistent with the worst available outcome, because the allowlist shrinks in step with the record
it guards.

**So the check is a grep, not a test run.** After resolving, assert directly against something the
resolution cannot delete:

```bash
git show HEAD:src/components/ward-management/ward-admissions.ts | grep -c dischargeConfirmed   # must be 4, not 0
```

This is the general shape worth carrying: **a test cannot verify a merge that can delete the test.**

**This resolution has an expiry.** It is correct only while Phase 8 has not touched those three files.
**Re-run `git merge-tree --write-tree` immediately before folding** and confirm the conflict set is
still exactly these three. If Phase 8 has since edited any of them, "take ours wholesale" silently
deletes that work with no failing gate.

## 3. State (verify against `git log`)

**Phases 1–7 — COMPLETE**, merged into the Phase 8 branch. Phase 6 is the morning page; Phase 7 is
the front door (referrals, matching, the coordinator's board).

**Phase 8 — the distance work. IN PROGRESS**, roughly task 4–8 of 10. Travel bands, the out-of-area
ledger, the network diagram rework. The remaining items at the time of writing: the diagram's third
step, the final visual pass, and a whole-branch review.

**The ward board — CALCULATION LAYER COMPLETE, no screens.** Nine commits, 116 tests, all green
together. Built to run safely beside Phase 8 by touching no file that exists on its branch.

| Module                      | What it holds                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ward-admissions.ts`        | The `Admission` record — the first person _inside_ a bed, not travelling toward one |
| `ward-admissions-seed.ts`   | 267 synthetic occupancies across 23 units                                           |
| `ward-discharge-dates.ts`   | The ward's date drives the bed release                                              |
| `ward-board-derivations.ts` | The headline figure and the constraint sentence under it                            |
| `ward-statistics.ts`        | Six ward-level flow figures                                                         |
| `ward-teams.ts`             | A synthetic community team per WA region                                            |

**Nothing renders. There is no screen, no page, no picture.** Every remaining task touches files
Phase 8 owns, so the screens wait for the fold.

## 4. The documents, in the order a newcomer should read them

1. **This file.**
2. `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-ward-flow-ward-board-design.md` — the ward board's binding
   specification. Numbered decisions with their reasoning, plus **DB-1 to DB-9**, the decisions taken
   _during_ the build, each recording what an implementer refused to invent.
3. `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-28-ward-flow-ward-board.md` — the task plan, its parallel-execution
   addendum, and the speed model.
4. `docs/ward-flow-roadmap.md` — direction and the refusals already settled, **with their reasons**. A
   refusal with no reason attached gets reversed by the next person who finds it inconvenient.
5. `docs/ward-flow-phase-6-7-decisions.md` — every owner decision through Phases 6 and 7.
6. `docs/ward-flow-phase-8-decisions.md` and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-ward-flow-phase-8-distance-design.md` — Phase 8.
7. `docs/ward-flow-clinician-check.md` — **the one-page summary still waiting to go to a clinician.**
8. `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` — repository rules. They override generic habits.

## 5. The constraints that override everything

1. **Never invent a legal figure.** No figure, timeframe, threshold or duration from the Mental Health
   Act, anywhere — code, copy, comment, test or fixture. A plain Voluntary/Involuntary label is
   permitted and is **not** a legal figure. If one seems needed, stop and ask.
2. **Synthetic data only. No free text anywhere.** Every category comes from a fixed runtime array
   with a membership check.
3. **No diagnosis.** Owner decision. The layout leaves space; adding it costs one field and needs a
   recorded decision.
4. **Nothing predicted, confirmed-but-unreleased, or on leave ever reaches "beds available right now."**
5. **Every bed dimension is "does this bed accept this person", never an equality.** Most beds are
   undesignated for sex, and undesignated accepts everyone; `bed.sexDesignation === referral.sex`
   would exclude most of the network **and looks entirely reasonable in review.**
6. **Local and offline only.** Never `verify:release`, any `eval:*`, `check:supabase-project`,
   `test:live`, or anything touching OpenAI, Supabase, hosted CI or a live database.
7. **Never push and never open a pull request.**
8. **Never `git stash`** — the stack is shared across every worktree on this machine.
9. **No gate skipped, no assertion deleted, no test loosened.**
10. **Never edit a file that exists on the other branch**, and never `git add -A` — another session may
    share the worktree.

## 6. The owner's decisions that must not be re-litigated

- **The bed is lost at the PULL, not the arrival** — even while the person waits on transport. His
  correction, and the rule the whole board rests on.
- **One discharge date drives everything.** Confirming is a **separate act** from setting it.
- **A discharge nobody has spoken about says nothing.** "Nothing outstanding" stays in the approved
  picker but is never assumed — silence and a clean bill are different facts.
- **Stay bands, verbatim — his four as of 2026-08-29 12:25:** under 2 weeks · 2 weeks–1 month ·
  1–3 months · over 3 months. Ids `under-2-weeks` / `2-weeks-1-month` / `1-3-months` /
  `over-3-months`, ceilings 14 / 30 / 90 / open, landed in `1d2f64c5f`.
  **This line previously recorded the SUPERSEDED set** — under 1 week · 1–4 weeks · 1–3 months ·
  over 3 months, ids `under-1-week` / `1-4-weeks`, from `4c3c4625a` at 03:49 the same day — and it
  recorded it under the word _verbatim_, inside a section headed "must not be re-litigated". So the
  rule written to protect his decisions was, for nine hours, the thing that would have carried a
  reversion of one: a cold-start session reading this line and then the code would have "corrected"
  the bands back in good faith, citing this document. **Date a verbatim list, or it eventually
  instructs someone to undo the decision it was written to preserve.** Left visible rather than
  silently replaced, because the failure is more useful than the correction.

  **Three overlapping layers held that stale line in place, not one**, and the reconstruction took
  two sessions being wrong in opposite directions first. The word _verbatim_ on the line; the §6
  heading above it; and §7 item 3 — "Verbatim rule unchanged; no agent may alter them" — which
  probably but not certainly governs it, since its subject is "the three approved lists" and nothing
  here defines the stay bands as one of the three. Note that §7 item 3 explicitly anticipates these
  lists CHANGING, and the document still went stale anyway: a rule that says "expect this to change"
  is not a mechanism for noticing when it has.

  **How the third layer was nearly lost from this record:** it was reported with the wrong section
  number, and I then "corrected" that to _no such rule exists_ on the strength of
  `grep -n "verbatim"` — which is case-sensitive, and §7 item 3 capitalises it. One hit became two
  under `grep -in`. Each of us had produced the version that better fitted our own account, and
  neither had checked the thing that made it better. **Search case-insensitively before reporting an
  absence, and treat "my grep found one" and "there is one" as different claims.**

- **The ward states its sex-acceptance counts daily.** No per-bed designations.
- **Ten WA regions stay.** Screens lead with region; travel distance is a footnote, because most
  patients have no band (the table covers 6 of 10 regions).
- **The bed tile:** solid fill for stay length, big day count, heavy outline when past its own date.
- **The transport officer screen answers one question** — which job can I start now, and if not why
  not. A task surface, never a statistics surface.
- **A rolling 24-hour clock**, not "before tonight". Lands in `ward-bed-availability.ts` and **changes
  the printed morning page's figures** — do it at the fold, and say so on the page.
- **Leave-bed usable is multi-role** and an override is **recorded**, by role and time. The stages
  rule is unchanged: wards move beds, coordinators watch.
- **The morning page does NOT gain the blocked-discharge figure** — declined for now.

## 7. Still owed by the owner

1. **The receiving-time options** — what a ward can say about when it can take a handover. Five
   drafted and unstruck: any time · business hours only · not overnight · after the afternoon
   handover · tomorrow, not today. Needed for the transport officer's screen.
2. **The clinician check.** `predicted → confirmed → released` (with `blocked` as a flag) has still
   never been put to a ward clinician. It has now been revised once without one. He asked to be
   reminded when this phase closes, not before.
3. The three approved lists are **liable to change** — expected to become more specific. Verbatim rule
   unchanged; no agent may alter them.

## 8. How to work here, learned the hard way

**Mutation-test every test.** Break what it guards, run it, watch it go red, quote the failure line,
restore. Seventeen tests across Phases 6 and 7 passed while the behaviour they named was broken.

**`mutate.sh` is broken** — it diffs the backup against a copy of itself, so "restore verified" only
ever proved `cp` succeeded. Use `git hash-object` before and after, and compare `git status
--porcelain` against a **pre-mutation snapshot** rather than requiring it to be empty (a check that is
always red is one people learn to ignore).

**`git checkout --` cannot restore an UNTRACKED file.** It leaves the mutation in place and the
porcelain listing looks identical. Back new files up out-of-tree and restore by copy.

**A mutation that fails to bite is a question, not an answer.** Three readings, not two: the test is
fake, the test is fine, or _the probe never exercised the property_. The third looks like both.

**An invariance test needs a companion that pins an absolute** in a case where the answers _should_
differ. "This number must not change" proves nothing when everything collapses to one value — a
function refusing everyone is perfectly invariant, and so is one accepting everyone.

**`npm run test:focused` refuses a NEW test file** and demands the full suite. Use
`node scripts/run-vitest.mjs run <files>` — same lock, one file.

**Quote the `N passed` line, never the exit code.** Results are memoised, so a re-run can exit 0
having printed nothing. `GATE_RECEIPTS=refresh` when fresh evidence is the point. A refusal citing
capacity, or exit 75, means **BLOCKED, retry** — never a failure.

**Do not run `lint`, `typecheck`, the full suite, `build` or Playwright per task.** They serialise
across every worktree on this machine. Run them once, at the end.

**The pre-commit hook refuses a commit whenever other unstaged or untracked files exist under
`src/components/` or `tests/`.** That is the real mechanism behind "one implementer per worktree":
concurrent agents can _write_, but only the controller can _commit_.

**Look at the rendered page.** Every defect that actually reached the screen in this project was found
by rendering and looking — never by a test. Three widths (390/820/1440) plus print.

**The sentence the whole programme has converged on:**

> **An absent signal reads exactly like a passing one.**

A guard that never ran, a scanner that lost its place and reported clean, a retry loop exiting 0 while
printing "STILL BLOCKED", a memoised gate exiting 0 having executed nothing, and a commit made without
reading the test output. All the same shape.

## 9. What happens next, in order

1. **Phase 8 finishes** and says so.
2. **The fold** — the ward board branch merges into Phase 8's. Re-read the model afterwards rather
   than trusting this page; it has changed twice already under finished designs.
3. **Something ugly on screen in the first hour.** One ward, real seeded data, no styling.
4. **The daily sheet, before the pretty parts** — timed with a stopwatch against a 20-bed ward.
5. **The board proper**, then the print sheet **built alongside it, not after**.
6. **The transport officer's screen, the statistics page**, and retiring the old ward screen — after
   enumerating every control on it and where each one went.
