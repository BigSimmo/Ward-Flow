# Page Wiring and Bundle Budget

## Current Ward Flow wiring and browser proof

Follow the [Ward entry point](../ward-flow/README.md), current source and accepted app.
Navigation is defined by `src/components/ward-management/ward-nav.ts` and
`ward-management-navigation.tsx`; routes live in `src/app/mockups/ward-flow/`.
Every offered action must work, or expose its unavailable reason accessibly. Preserve focus,
keyboard use and status meaning; do not copy a foreign route catalogue or widen lint exemptions.

For a new route, wire it into the actual role navigation and verify its reachable URL and
interaction. Use the [screen map](../ward-flow/SCREEN-MAP.md), selected route/nav tests and
affected browser journey. Ward's `chromium-mockups` project is used by
`npm run test:e2e:ward-journeys`; its prototype path does not make the required selected browser
proof advisory. The [public CI policy](../ward-flow/PUBLIC-CI.md) and actual workflow define
the selected gate. Declaration, local result and hosted result remain separate evidence.

Before browser work, run `npm run ensure`, use the printed URL and verify `/api/local-project-id`
identifies the intended project/worktree/runtime. Screenshots alone do not prove controls;
exercise relevant interactions. For visual exploration follow Fast Preview; retain the
selected production-stage checks when integration/release validation is commissioned.

## Build output and bundle claims

The bundle-budget incident below belongs to the former PsychSift repository. Its absent
catalogues, routes and checker are not a current Ward gate; do not claim those budgets passed.
For current bundle/build measurements, inspect the actual Ward build command and attribution
before making a budget claim. Build identity and inputs must match the result being reported.

Do not delete a preview's `.next` output as a routine measurement step. Use an owned isolated
build run and output path accepted by `next.config.ts` (`.next-playwright/<run-id>/dist` via
`NEXT_DIST_DIR`), or a separate owned build worktree. Check process/output ownership first,
keep the preview intact, and clean only the validated run directory after its processes stop.
The existing Playwright wrapper manages its own isolated build output; inspect its contract
instead of inventing a second cleanup procedure.

## Historical PsychSift wiring and bundle incident

The preserved procedure below is dated evidence. It does not establish current Ward routes,
browser exemptions, configured budgets, or provider access.

# Page and button wiring

Interactive controls and routes follow conventions the codebase already holds to. Before adding
or moving a button, link, or route, read `docs/wiring-conventions.md`. A control that advertises an
action must perform one; a page that ships must be reachable.

- **Buttons.** Every interactive `<button>` must do something: an `onClick`, a `type="submit"`
  inside a `<form onSubmit>`, or navigation (wrap it in a `<Link>` / call `router.push`). A control
  that is unavailable for a **stated reason** — feature not built, or this record lacks the data —
  uses `aria-disabled="true"` + `onClick={ignoreUnavailableActivation}` + `title="… — coming soon"`
  - an `sr-only` note wired via `aria-describedby` (see `favourites-hub.tsx`). Native `disabled`
    would remove the tab stop and the reason would never be reached. Keep native `disabled` for
    **transient** inertness (request in flight, pager at its last page, form action awaiting
    validity). Never both attributes on one button — lint fails on the pair. **Never** ship a styled,
    `aria-label`led button with no handler and no disabled state — that was the "Language and region"
    defect fixed 2026-07-21.
- **Navigation.** Internal navigation uses `<Link>`, `router.push`, or server `redirect()` — never
  a raw `<a href="/…">` to an internal route. Build hrefs from the existing sources
  (`src/lib/app-modes.ts`, `src/lib/tools-catalog.ts`, `src/lib/universal-search.ts`), not
  hardcoded strings scattered across components.
- **New-route checklist.** Add the page → link it from real nav (sidebar / launcher / mode home /
  search) → `npm run docs:update` → document it in `docs/codebase-index.md` → add a
  reachability/coverage assertion. A production page route with no inbound link is an orphan.
  The committed pre-commit hook runs this synchronization for relevant staged changes and stops
  when generated docs need review/staging; it never stages files automatically.
- **Gates.** `eslint-rules/require-button-wiring.mjs` (in `npm run lint`) fails on an un-wired
  `<button>`; `tests/route-reachability.test.ts` (in `npm run test`) fails when a production page
  route has no inbound nav link unless it is consciously added to that test's documented
  allowlist (redirect targets / legacy-compat routes). Both run in `verify:cheap` and CI. Mockups
  (`src/app/mockups/**`, `*-mockups.tsx`) are design-scratch and exempt from both. **Corrected
  2026-09-02: "and from nothing else" was wrong** — reading the actual rule and config sources,
  mockups are also exempt from `local/no-hardcoded-hex`, `local/require-z-index-ladder` and
  `local/require-lucide-icon-aria` (`eslint.config.mjs`), from `check:icon-scale` and
  `check:design-system-contract`, and from the required Playwright lane (mockup specs carry
  `@mockup` and the `chromium` project sets `grepInvert`; `chromium-mockups` is advisory).
  Two exemptions people assume and that do NOT exist, both verified by glob semantics on
  2026-09-02: **CodeRabbit reviews mockup source normally** — `.coderabbit.yaml`'s `!mockups/**`
  is root-anchored and excludes only the repo-root `mockups/` notes directory, not
  `src/app/mockups/**` or `*-mockups.tsx`; and **`knip` is not blind to this surface** —
  `knip.json` ignores files whose _basename_ contains `mockup`, so `*-mockups.tsx` is exempt but
  the `src/app/mockups/<slug>/page.tsx` routes and the `*/mockups/**` subtrees are not.
  (`check:knip` does run `--include dependencies,unlisted,unresolved,duplicates`, omitting
  unused-file and unused-export analysis — but that is repo-wide, not a mockup carve-out.)
  Note too that the three exemption globs disagree with each other, so `care-plan/mockups/**`,
  `caring-contacts/mockups/**` and `ward-management/**` are exempt from fewer rules than the
  depth-1 `*-mockups.tsx` files. Mockups are still compiled like any other source: they are
  typechecked, and their client chunks are still weighed by `check:bundle-budget` — against the
  separate `mockups` scratch budget, not the `production` one (reconciled 2026-08-09; see
  "Bundle budget" below). Do not read "exempt" as "free", and do not read this correction as
  licence to widen the list.
- **Retiring a mockup is governed by `docs/mockup-retirement-policy.md`**, enforced by
  `npm run check:mockups`. Deleting one needs a written successor plus a clean import search, not a
  reachability scan and not a `-v2`/`-final`/`-perfected` suffix — in this repo a mockup and the
  production change it justifies usually land in the SAME commit, and in at least five families the
  newer generation imports the older one. `/mockups/development`, `/mockups/caring-contacts`,
  `/mockups/care-plan` and `/mockups/ward-flow` are live in production behind `DeveloperAreaGate`
  and are never cleanup candidates.
- **Never** add a production page route without either an inbound link or a documented
  reachability allowlist entry plus a task-ledger note, and never silence the button-wiring rule
  with a blanket disable — wire the control or make it an explicit placeholder.

# Bundle budget

`check:bundle-budget` enforces **three complementary safeguards** in `bundle-budget.json`:

- **`production`** — every chunk a non-mockup route reaches, plus chunks no route manifest claims
  (framework, polyfills, runtime). This is user-facing weight and the real regression guard.
  Tolerance 10%. A failure here means find the regression; do not refresh the baseline to clear it.
- **`routes`** — client JavaScript referenced by `/` and `/documents/search`, the same journeys
  measured by Lighthouse. Each route has a 10% tolerance, so local growth cannot hide inside a
  still-healthy repository aggregate. `/therapy-compass`, `/dsm` and `/forms` were in this list
  and were deliberately removed: home consolidation turned all three into redirect stubs that
  render the same shared home as `/`, so budgeting them measured `/` three more times rather than
  covering anything new (see `tests/check-lighthouse-budget.test.ts`, `COMMITTED_ROUTES`). Do not
  re-add them without also un-consolidating the homes; if a mode's own surface needs its own
  budget, the route to add is its `/search` view, which is a genuinely different bundle.
- **`mockups`** — chunks reachable **only** from `/mockups/**`. Nobody downloads these, so this is a
  repo-hygiene ceiling for unbounded accumulation, not a per-mockup gate. Tolerance 25%.

A chunk shared by a mockup and a production route counts as production — it would be built either
way. Attribution comes from the per-route `*_client-reference-manifest.js` files under
`.next/server/app`; if that tree is missing, resolves no routes, or omits a configured route, the
check **fails closed** rather than collapsing the buckets or silently dropping a route.

Why the split rather than a raised ceiling: measured on `main` at `af85cbc`, the repo-wide total was
+9.96% of the old single baseline — 576 bytes from failing `Build` — while production-only was
**9.06% below** it. Every byte of the apparent regression was design scratch; production had
actually shrunk since the baseline was captured. Raising the ceiling would have hidden that.

**Measuring:** `npm run build` reuses a cached `.next`, and the check then reads stale output and
reports byte-identical numbers — it will tell you the budget passes when it does not. Always
`rm -rf .next` before measuring, and sanity-check `.next/BUILD_ID`'s mtime against the current
commit before trusting a number.
