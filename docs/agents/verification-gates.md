# Verification Gates and the Gate Arbiter

<!-- BEGIN:verification-gates -->

## Gate selection

- **Verification principle:** run the smallest check capable of detecting a plausible regression introduced by the current diff. Before starting a check, identify the failure class it covers, whether a successful check already covered that class, whether a cheaper focused check offers comparable detection, and whether the incremental confidence justifies the runtime, resource use, and repository-lock contention. If there is no plausible changed failure path, do not run the check.

| Tier                    | Use when                                                                                                                            | Default evidence                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 — No test command     | Explanation, planning, prompt writing, read-only inspection, or no repository change                                                | No test, build, server, or baseline command                                                                          |
| 1 — Static/focused      | Documentation, comments, metadata, or narrow non-behavioural configuration                                                          | Relevant format, docs, syntax, generated-file, or diff check only                                                    |
| 2 — Focused behavioural | A localized helper, component, contract, or test change                                                                             | Directly affected unit/DOM/contract test; add typecheck only when the edit can affect compilation or a type contract |
| 3 — Domain gate         | Shared UI/routing, dependencies, security, privacy, RAG, clinical output, production configuration, or another cross-cutting domain | The smallest applicable repository/domain selector, focused journey, or contract gate                                |
| 4 — Broad handoff       | The diff crosses multiple subsystems, cannot be bounded reliably, or the task explicitly requires PR/release confidence             | One appropriate broad gate, selected rather than stacked by default                                                  |

- Do not run a broad baseline routinely before localized work, and do not select `verify:cheap` merely because a change is described as “non-trivial.” Use `npm run verify:cheap` once when cross-module risk warrants a broad offline gate. Use `npm run verify:pr-local` when a change is ready for PR handoff: it now classifies the changed paths, runs focused documentation/workflow contracts for recognised low-risk scopes, and fails closed to lint, typecheck, the full unit suite, RAG fixture validation, and relevant build/domain gates for executable or unknown scope. If the diff has not changed, do not run `verify:cheap` first merely to repeat the same coverage.
- Do not stack focused tests, full tests, typecheck, lint, build, and browser checks unless each catches a distinct plausible regression. Do not rerun an unchanged successful gate. Since 2026-08-21 that last rule is enforced rather than remembered: `scripts/gate-receipts.mjs` memoises `lint`, `typecheck` and non-coverage Vitest runs against a content signature, so an identical re-run on unchanged content exits 0 immediately instead of repeating the work. A reused receipt must be reported as "reused receipt from <time>", never as a fresh run; use `GATE_RECEIPTS=refresh` when fresh evidence is the point, `GATE_RECEIPTS=off` to disable, and `npm run receipts` to inspect the store. Receipts are local-only and never reach CI — `CI` being set disables reuse outright, because GitHub remains the authoritative merge gate. Do not memoise `build` or `test:coverage`; their artefacts are read by later gates. Contract: `docs/process-hardening.md` and `tests/gate-receipts.test.ts`. A deliberately skipped low-yield broad gate is not automatically verification debt; report the skipped check and its risk-based reason concisely.
- A fast-fail subset may precede a broader required gate only when the later gate excludes that subset for the same event; retain a fail-safe full path whenever the subset is skipped. Likewise, do not pre-run a build, install, or server setup that the selected wrapper performs itself. Guard these disjoint/fallback rules with workflow contract tests so a later edit cannot silently restore duplicate work or create a coverage hole.
- Use dry-run selectors before expensive gates when scope is uncertain. `npm run verify:pr-local -- --dry-run --files <comma-separated paths>` inspects PR-local selection without running commands. The broader `--extended` plan is dry-run only unless explicit approval is reflected by `ALLOW_EXTENDED_PR_LOCAL=true`.
- CI uses the same fail-closed scope model: recognised docs and workflow/policy-only changes run focused contracts; executable product/test/config, dependency, database, container, RAG, security-sensitive, mixed, or unknown paths retain the applicable heavy jobs. Do not broaden a path trigger or restore an always-on heavy job without evidence that the focused route misses a realistic failure class. Scheduled drift/release checks and the always-reporting `PR required` aggregate remain safety backstops.
- Let the repository run coordinator control cross-worktree verification. It permits at most two focused Vitest/read-only typecheck leases from different worktrees; full Vitest, coverage, lint, build, Playwright, and live-provider tests remain exclusive. Do not install while a repository test, build, lint, typecheck, or server command is active. Avoid aggressive short-interval polling, and do not repeat an unchanged full gate after it passes.
- **Running several Claude Code sessions at once is safe only when each session works from its own worktree (`newtask`) and no two sessions target the same branch or pull request.** Inside that boundary the coordinator above already lets safe work overlap — two sessions can hold a focused-test/typecheck lease together, and heavier gates (lint, build, full tests, Playwright) simply queue behind each other rather than colliding. Never work around a busy/queued coordinator message by forcing or deleting lock state; wait, or narrow the gate. The single biggest thing that makes other sessions wait is one session holding a broader gate than the change needs, so keep to the narrowest tier in the verification pyramid above.
- For UI, frontend, browser, routing, styling, reduced-motion, or forced-colors behaviour changes, run `npm run ensure` before browser work and prove the changed owner or journey first. Use `npm run verify:ui` when shared UI foundations changed or PR/handoff policy requires the complete Chromium gate, not as an automatic addition after focused proof. For phone-chrome changes, run `npm run verify:phone-chrome` first: it checks installed-lock parity, selects the affected browser/PWA owners and exact journeys, and adds `verify:ui` last only when shared chrome foundations make the broad gate necessary. Inspect uncertain scope with `-- --dry-run`. Chromium evidence does not close physical Safari or installed-PWA acceptance gaps.

- For explicit release confidence, use `npm run verify:release` once; this includes the full Playwright project set and retains all provider-approval requirements. Ordinary local completion or PR handoff does not by itself authorize or require this release gate.
- For clinical ingestion, answer generation, source governance, privacy, production-readiness, or environment changes, run the smallest relevant domain check plus `npm run check:production-readiness`.
- For pull requests that touch ingestion, answer generation, search/ranking, source rendering, document access, privacy, production env, or clinical output, complete the clinical governance preflight in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- Track known verification debts and staged process improvements in `docs/process-hardening.md` instead of relying on chat-only memory.

## Do not pay twice for the verdict GitHub is about to reach

`check:gate-manifest` enforces a one-way invariant: CI never runs LESS of the local
`verify:cheap` static set than the local chain does. Read that the other way and it says
something uncomfortable — **every local run of a gate in that chain is work GitHub is
about to repeat.** `gate-receipts.mjs` removed the local-versus-local duplication (the
same gate twice on unchanged content); it explicitly cannot touch this one, because CI
must never reuse a receipt.

That does not make the local run waste. It is a **bet**: a local run that fails saves a CI
round trip, and a red or superseded push is expensive here (~40% of PR CI runs measured
2026-07-30 were cancellations). A local run that passes bought nothing the CI run would not
have established. So the question is never "local or CI" in the abstract, it is:

> **Is this gate, on this kind of change, still catching anything?**

**The rule: run an expensive local gate only while it is still earning its runtime, and
never re-derive a verdict that already exists.** Before running `lint`, `typecheck`,
`test`, `verify:cheap`, or `verify:pr-local`, consult the arbiter and quote its verdict:

```bash
npm run arbiter -- <gate>      # RUN / DEFER / PROVEN, with its evidence
npm run arbiter:status         # the yield ledger and the duplication bill so far
```

It weighs three inputs, none of them hard-coded, so the answer moves as the repo moves:

1. **CI coverage**, derived live from `package.json` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and
   evaluated **for this change** — the step's own `if:` and its job's `if:` are checked
   against the current change scope, because a step's presence in the YAML is not
   coverage. `lint` and `typecheck` are step-conditional on `static_heavy_changed` and
   `test:coverage` is job-conditional on `coverage_changed`, so a docs-only change is
   covered by none of them. A gate CI does not re-run is never deferrable — local is the
   only gate there is. Delete the CI job and the arbiter stops deferring to it the same day.
2. **Observed yield**, a rolling per-gate, per-change-class window of local outcomes that
   the gate wrappers record automatically. A gate that has caught nothing across a full
   clean window on this class of change has stopped earning its runtime. The **first catch
   resets the window** and the gate runs locally again, so the loop re-arms itself instead
   of decaying toward "never check anything".
3. **Content identity** — a verdict GitHub already reached on exactly this content
   (recorded with `npm run arbiter -- record-ci <sha> <gates…>` when a session observes CI
   go green) is not re-derived locally. This is the common repetition: CI goes green on a
   branch head, and a later session runs the whole suite again on that same head. Name the
   gates CI actually ran — the command refuses a bare invocation rather than turning one
   observed job into proof for every gate.

The window is per change class because the classes are not the same bet: docs-only clears
in 3 clean runs, source in 12, and **db, RAG, dependency, container, workflow, UI and
unrecognised scope never defer at all**, however clean the history — the same fail-closed
routing CI itself uses, not a second risk model.

Non-negotiable boundaries, all of them the conservative direction:

- **Fail open.** Missing data, unreadable CI, an unknown change class, a git failure — every
  one of them runs the gate. A bug in the arbiter costs a redundant run, never a skipped one.
- **CI is never advised by it.** `CI` being set disables the arbiter outright. GitHub stays
  the authoritative merge gate and nothing computed locally may influence what it runs.
- **Advisory by default.** A `DEFER` or `PROVEN` verdict is a recommendation printed with
  its evidence; the wrappers act on it only under `GATE_ARBITER=enforce`. Silently skipping
  a gate a human typed is exactly the failure the evidence rules exist to prevent.
- **A focused run is not full-suite evidence.** A narrowed Vitest invocation records under
  its own identity, so a clean run of single-file tests can never let the whole suite defer.
- **A deferred gate is not a passed gate.** Report it as "deferred to CI — <gate> has caught
  nothing in N consecutive <class> runs", never as green, and never alongside a claim that
  the gate ran. The same applies to `PROVEN`: say "reused receipt" or "CI-proven at `<sha>`".

This does not license skipping verification. It licenses not buying the _same_ verdict
twice. The smallest-correct-gate rule above still decides which gate is right; the arbiter
only decides whether that gate has anything left to tell you before you push.

## The browser gate is narrowed, not deferred

`npm run verify:ui` is the most expensive run here — 646 Chromium tests, ~25 minutes —
and CI repeats it wholesale: `Production UI critical` and the three `Production UI`
shards are guarded on `ui_changed`, so any change touching a browser surface gets the
full suite on GitHub whether or not it ran locally first.

The arbiter above cannot help with it. Its lever is deferral, and `ui` is in
`NEVER_DEFER_CLASSES` — pushing a UI change with **no** browser evidence is not a bet
this repository takes, and that stays true. The lever here is a different one: run the
part of the suite the diff can actually break.

```bash
npm run plan:browser              # dry run: the level it chose, the specs, and why
npm run plan:browser -- --run     # execute that plan
npm run plan:browser -- --full    # force the whole suite
```

Four levels, and only the middle two are a saving:

| Level     | When                                                     | What runs                                                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`    | no browser surface changed                               | nothing — CI skips Production UI for this scope too                                    |
| `changed` | a `ui-*.spec.ts` changed                                 | those specs, **complete** — never grepped, since the diff rewrote their own assertions |
| `focused` | changed UI source attributable to specs                  | the owning specs, complete                                                             |
| `full`    | shared foundation, unattributable file, or unknown scope | `verify:ui`                                                                            |

**Attribution is evidence, not a table.** A spec owns a changed file when both contain
the same literal — a `data-testid` the source renders and the spec asks for, or a route
the source defines and the spec navigates to. Component names are deliberately not
matched: a spec never names a component, so a match there would be a comment, and a
comment is not proof a journey covers the code.

**It fails closed, the opposite of the arbiter.** A file with no owning spec, a shared
foundation (`globals.css`, any shared style root, the Playwright config, the runner, the
shell/chrome coordinator set), a browser-lane path it cannot classify, or a deleted
file all escalate to the full suite on their own. The arbiter's bug costs a redundant
run; this one's would cost an unrun journey, so the defaults point the other way.

**The project is part of the selection.** `chromium` grep-inverts `@mockup` and
`chromium-mockups` collects only those, so a mockup spec run under `--project=chromium`
collects nothing and "passes" having executed no test. The planner reads both
`testMatch` patterns out of `playwright.config.ts` (rather than copying them, which
would drift) and routes each selected spec accordingly — `tests/ui-tools.spec.ts` holds
both kinds and gets both projects. A spec neither project collects escalates to the full
suite rather than producing a command that matches nothing.

**Coverage that rests on an unreadable precondition is reported as conditional.**
`ui-critical-fast` is guarded on `github.event.pull_request.draft != true`, which no
worktree can evaluate. On a draft PR CI skips the very job that makes narrowing safe, so
the planner prints those assumptions with the verdict instead of stating flatly that CI
will repeat the run.

Non-negotiable, and the reason the saving is allowed at all:

- **A narrowed run is not the UI gate.** Report it as "focused browser proof at level
  `<x>`, full suite left to CI" — never "verify:ui passed". `check:browser-test-plan`
  and `tests/browser-test-plan.test.ts` pin that wording in the runner itself.
- **CI is untouched.** The planner advises local work only; GitHub runs exactly what it
  ran before, and no required check may be weakened to save local time.
- **Dry run by default.** `--run` executes; nothing happens without it.
- **When CI will NOT repeat it** — a browser-lane change on a scope where the Production
  UI jobs are skipped — the planner says so and tells you to consider `--full`, because
  there the local run is the only browser evidence there will be.

Cloud sessions are told this at SessionStart by `.claude/hooks/testing-policy.sh`, which
is read-only, exits 0 on every path, and states the reporting rules alongside the
commands.
