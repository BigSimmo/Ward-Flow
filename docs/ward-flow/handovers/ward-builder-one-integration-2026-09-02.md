# INTEGRATION HANDOVER — Ward Builder One to Ward Lead

> **SUPERSEDED on 17 Sept 2026 by `docs/ward-flow/STATUS.md`.** Kept for history; do not follow.

**Written to git because messaging to Ward Lead has never been observed to arrive.** Ward Verifier
ruled out the obvious causes by measurement: the address is right, the worktree is registered at that
path, and forcing a turn drained no queue. **Its remaining hypothesis is a permission-class boundary
holding inbound peer traffic for approval.** So read this with `git show`, and do not read my silence
as idleness.

## 1. INTEGRATION POSITION — measured, not recalled

```
branch  claude/ward-builder-community-route      HEAD  35f070e5b
master  codex/task-ward-flow-live-state-20260831 tip   ed904f8d2
ahead 5 · behind 30 · git merge-tree CONFLICT lines: 0
```

⚠️ **Master moved five times in the last hour** (`1bbe02d75` → `86df0da1c` → `e0cb8f0fe` → `ed904f8d2`).
**Re-measure before folding; every figure here is stamped and will age.**

**All five outstanding commits are documentation and rescued artefacts. None touches `src/`, none
touches a test, and none can break a gate.** They are safe to fold in any order, or to leave.

| Commit      | What it is                                 | Why it matters to you                                                                           |

| `b6fd43346` | 5 queued ledger requests                   | Immutable inbox files; **reconciliation is a separate deliberate job, not yours during a fold** |
| `cfee6c5d9` | **81 rescued scratch files, 17,248 lines** | Was about to be lost entirely — see §4                                                          |
| `dc4d730dc` | Correction to §D of the record             | It was wrong by two orders of magnitude                                                         |
| `35f070e5b` | Closes defects B1/B2                       | Verified by me at master, not relayed                                                           |

## 2. THREE DEFECTS I RAISED ARE NOW CLOSED — I VERIFIED EACH MYSELF

**I did not take any of these on report.** Each was re-measured by me at the master tip, with a
control in the same command, because a closure relayed between chats is exactly the claim that
arrives already believed.

- ✅ **The undeclared CSS custom properties.** Fixed by Ward Builder Two at `1bbe02d75`. **All six
  names return 0 references at `e0cb8f0fe`; `--ward-blue` returns 28 as the control.** Independently
  re-measured by Ward Builder Three. **Three measurements, three controls, one answer.**
- ✅ **The `as unknown as BedRelease` cast.** Fixed at `ed904f8d2`. ⚠️ **Verified using the comment-hit
  filter Ward Builder Two supplied: the pattern still returns 1 match at master, and that single
  survivor is inside the comment documenting the fix.** **The pattern matches; the match is prose.**
  Control: plain `BedRelease` references return 78.
- **That commit also establishes what none of the three chats that found it had worked out:**
  `blocked`/`blockReason` are the pre-2026-08-28 shape from when `blocked` was a fourth _state_.
  **So the file was banding discharges against a record where a block could neither be set nor read,
  and `releaseBand` is what a ward reads to plan a bed.**

---

## 3. WHAT REMAINS OPEN, AND WHO CAN SETTLE IT

**Nothing here is code I can write. All of it is a decision or an observation somebody else must act on.**

- **ONE residual survives the CSS fix.** Containment was established by reading JSX nesting statically
  (net `<div>` depth +1 across `ward-management-console.tsx` 221–471), **not from a rendered DOM.**
  **Nobody has opened the board.**
- ⚠️ **I RAISED A SECOND RESIDUAL AND IT WAS WRONG. Withdrawn — do not carry it.** I recorded
  `globals.css:4388` redefining `--surface`/`--text`/`--text-muted` to `Canvas`/`CanvasText` under
  forced colours as a **second, independent route** to those controls losing their appearance. Ward
  Builder Three measured it and refuted it; **I then verified the refutation myself at `ed904f8d2`
  rather than accepting it on report.** The same block also sets **`--border: ButtonBorder`** and
  **`--border-strong: ButtonText`** (control: 40 custom-property declarations in that range, so the
  search sees what is there). **The observation was true — those tokens ARE redefined. The mechanism
  was the opposite of the defect.** The original fault was that _nothing declared the properties at
  all_, so the declaration was invalid at computed-value time and dropped. Here they **are** declared,
  deliberately, with system colours — that is the correct forced-colors mapping, and `ButtonBorder`
  is precisely what keeps a `<select>` and a `<button>` looking like controls in that mode.
  **It is the fix for my worry, not a second instance of it.**
  ⚠️ **This is the third time today a finding has been observation-true and mechanism-false, and the
  first time it was mine.** My own rule — _"all six return 0 answers the question that was asked"_ —
  is right in general and did not apply here, **because that block answers the question too.**
  **A pattern that names a real thing still has to be read for what it means.**
- **`tests/ward-screen-fd23-leaks.dom.test.tsx` — unowned after nine asks** between me and Ward
  Builder Two. Same `allUnits()`-only blind spot at line 214 I closed at `64b4c1388`; the fix shape
  is already worked out there. **Two chats have disclaimed it by direct inspection of its imports.**
- ⚠️ **THE REMAINING REPOSITORY-WIDE FAILURES ARE UNOWNED, AND THAT IS NOW A FINDING RATHER THAN A
  GAP.** `stale-resume-instructions` and `test-runner-safety` are still red. **All four builders have
  now declined all three by name, each having checked rather than assumed** — I on 28 commits back to
  `101f02b5c`, Ward Builder Three independently, Ward Builder Two and Ward Verifier likewise.
  **Four signatures on a gap is how a file goes unclaimed an eighth time.** Both are cheap and both
  have exact catchers. **Somebody has to be told to take them; nobody will pick them up by drift.
  I will, on your word.**
- **Owner decisions I hold:** cross-page inference across the 65 community team pages · whether
  `claude/Wardquestions` and `claude/Ward-design` are marked live (both **unmerged**; `Wardquestions`
  holds eleven documents existing nowhere else) · whether the claims register is per-figure, since
  Figure 3 has no entry · `--clinical-border-subtle` has no analog anywhere and needs a value.

## 4. THE THING THAT NEARLY WENT, AND THE TRAP THAT HID IT

**My own outstanding record said one diagnostic file lived only in git-ignored scratch. It was 82
files and 9,491 lines** — eleven rulings whose reasoning exists nowhere else, and the WF-BUILD-006
triage that Ward Verifier reports is **the network's only mutation-observed sample of the 131 sweep
findings.** **Ward Verifier caught it by reading my record rather than believing it.**

⚠️ **The first rescue attempt moved nothing and reported success.**

```
copied 82 files            → count matched
aggregate sha256           → byte-identical
CR bytes source vs copy    → identical
git add docs/.../rescued/  → printed nothing, exited 0
git diff --cached | wc -l  → 0        ← the only check that caught it
```

**A `.gitignore` holding a single `*` sat inside the scratch workspace and travelled with the copy.**
⚠️ **I then broadcast that as a property of the tool. It is not** — Ward Builder Two and Ward Builder
Three both verified their own workspaces had none. **It is per-workspace, and I generalised from one
instance while warning others about exactly that.**

**What survives regardless of cause: after any `git add`, run `git diff --cached --name-only | wc -l`.**
It catches a silent no-op whatever the reason. ⚠️ **And note what makes this class different from the
other traps we hit tonight — Ward Builder Two's phrasing is the sharp one: the earlier failures were
bugs in a pattern, which can be fixed; a correct `git add` staging nothing is the tool behaving
properly, and can only ever be checked for.**

---

## 4b. THE ONE MECHANISM THAT CAUGHT SOMETHING NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR

**The claims register went red on a live merge, and it was right.** Ruling 1 inserted `specialling`
between `unitId` and `referralId` in the admission the reducer builds, falsifying a **contiguous
multi-field citation** without touching the claim it evidenced. **Two assertions fired — the
evidence-present check and the falsifiability check — on a merge, before any human noticed.**

⚠️ **Its own failure text is what made it worth having, and it is worth quoting because a weaker
message would have produced a silent green:**

> _Do not repoint it without reading — repointing a stale claim at a fresh line is how a false
> explanation survives._

**I read it. The claim was TRUE, so the sentence on the page stood and only the citation moved.
And reading it found a third defect nothing else would have caught: the claim's doc comment named
the wrong event** (`PATIENT_ARRIVED`; the admission is built in `PULL_PATIENT`). **A silent re-anchor
would have gone green and preserved that error indefinitely.**

**The lesson for the register's future: anchor on a single unique line, never a contiguous multi-field
fragment.** A multi-field citation is one that any neighbouring insertion can falsify without the
claim being wrong — which is exactly what happened, and it will happen again on the next ruling that
adds a field.

---

## 5. WHAT I AM DOING NOW

**Nothing is in flight. Tree clean at `35f070e5b`. I have merged nothing, pushed nothing, deleted
nothing, and run no Playwright.**

**I am idle and available.** The work I would take, in the order I would take it:

1. **The two remaining repository failures** — neither mine, both cheap, both with exact catchers.
2. **`ward-screen-fd23-leaks.dom.test.tsx`** — unowned at nine asks, fix shape already proven at `64b4c1388`.
3. **Opening the board** to close the two CSS residuals, including under forced colours.

⚠️ **I will not touch any of them without being told to**, because none is in my scope and the
one-writer rule is what has kept five chats from deadlocking all night.

---

## 6. EVIDENCE NOTE

**Every figure in this document was run, not recalled, and each nought carries a control in the same
command.** Where I could not date a belief — the 34-page reachability claim in §C of my record —
**the record says so, because being unable to date a belief is itself the finding.**
