# Re-export blindness sweep — is `ward-referral-matching.test.ts`'s hole a pattern?

Read at `codex/task-ward-flow-live-state-20260831` = `425fba106b58f99f38aa2b775e8837bda154ca35`,
via `git show <sha>:<path>` / `git archive <sha> -- tests` into a scratch extraction (no working-tree
reads). No files edited; this report is the only file created.

## The confirmed defect (context, not re-derived here)

`tests/ward-referral-matching.test.ts`'s own `collectModuleGraph`/`importStatementsOf` walks
`source.match(/import\s+[\s\S]*?;/g)` only. It never looks at `export … from` statements, so a
passthrough module (`export { BedRelease } from "./ward-model"`) is visited, found to contain no
`import` statement, and the walk stops without reaching what it re-exports.

## Coverage figures (required)

- **Enumerated:** 1069 files under `tests/` at the pinned commit (via `git ls-tree`, screenshots
  excluded).
- **Opened in full or substantially:** 24 files — the 4 confirmed-relevant Ward Flow files, the 2
  shared architecture-boundary files, `tests/helpers/module-graph.ts`, and 17 further candidates
  found through targeted keyword search (`queue`/`entryFiles`/`collectModuleGraph`, `readdirSync`
  - `readFileSync`, boundary/contract/guard filename patterns). Two of the largest (`rsc-boundary
.test.ts` at 1699 lines, `ward-legal-figure-guard.test.ts` at 1730 lines) were read to the point
    the graph-construction logic was fully visible (~1400 and ~1030 lines respectively) — the
    unread remainder is fixtures/assertions, not additional graph-building code.
- **Judged by pattern/grep alone:** roughly 40 further files matched broad greps (`readFileSync`,
  `"from"` + quote, `boundary|seam|graph|isolation`) that were ruled out by a second, narrower
  grep showing the match was unrelated (SQL/CSS comment-stripping locals also named
  `withoutComments`, a single-file text check, or an exhaustive non-graph scan) — not by opening
  the file. This is a pattern scan, not a full read, for that set.
- **Could not resolve / not reached at all:** the remaining ~1000 files were never searched
  individually beyond the keyword passes above. A test that builds an import/module graph using
  vocabulary this sweep didn't search for (a helper function or local named neither "queue" nor
  "collectModuleGraph" nor "entryFiles", with no boundary/seam/contract/guard-shaped filename)
  would not have surfaced. This is a real gap, not a formality — the brief's own worked example
  was found only because its filename and doc comments were distinctive.

## BLIND

**`tests/ward-referral-screen-boundary.test.ts`** — enforces FD-23 (a ward-facing screen may reach
referral data only through the ward-scoped projection, per the owner's 2026-08-30 ruling that "a
ward cannot see where else a patient has been referred"). Its own comment says the module-graph
machinery is "lifted from `tests/ward-referral-matching.test.ts`'s D15 contract... `collectModuleGraph`,
`scanSource` and the two tests that pin the comment scanner are lifted from there deliberately."
The lift is verbatim: `importStatementsOf` (line 333) is `withoutComments(source).match(/import\s+[\s\S]*?;/g) ?? []`
— the identical regex, never matching `export … from`. **Smallest edit that slips past it:** add a
barrel file under the ward-only subgraph, e.g. `export { Referral } from "./ward-model";`, imported
by a ward-facing component as `import { Referral } from "./referral-barrel"`. `FULL_REFERRAL_VOCABULARY`
would flag the identifier `Referral` if it appeared in an _import statement_ the walk reaches, but the
walk never reaches the barrel's re-export line to discover it forwards `Referral`, and the ward
component's own import of the barrel names no forbidden identifier either (it imports `Referral` from
a specifier the vocabulary check doesn't recognise as referral-bearing, since `REFERRAL_BEARING_MODULES`
only matches the _target_ module names `ward-model`/`ward-referrals`/`ward-referral-visibility`, not an
arbitrary barrel). This is the same class of hole as the original, on a privacy/visibility boundary
rather than a matching-independence contract — arguably higher-consequence, since it is the guard
against a ward screen leaking a patient's other referral destinations.

**`tests/ward-referral-matching.test.ts`** — already confirmed by the brief; not re-derived.

No other file in the 24 opened, and none of the ~40 ruled out by narrower grep, reproduces this
exact regex-only-import scanner.

## N-A (reads source text but does not traverse a module/import graph)

These enforce a rule by reading one or a handful of named files directly, or by reading whole-file
text/identifiers exhaustively without ever following an import edge — there is no "walk" for a
re-export to hide from:

`tests/dsm-category-colour-boundary.test.ts`, `tests/calculator-mockup-boundary.test.ts`,
`tests/production-mockup-boundary.test.ts`, `tests/favourites-demo-boundary.test.ts`,
`tests/mode-home-loading-contract.test.ts`, `tests/chip-contract.test.ts`,
`tests/api-validation-contract.test.ts`, `tests/hosted-migration-role-guard.test.ts`,
`tests/installed-lock-parity.test.ts`, `tests/test-runner-safety.test.ts`,
`tests/ward-travel-grouping.test.ts` (its "only ward-distance.ts reads the fixture" test is an
exhaustive whole-`src`-directory text scan, not a graph walk — separately, it duplicates
`ward-referral-matching.test.ts`'s comment-scanner `scanSource`/`withoutComments` for its own
purposes and pins that copy with its own tests, but does not duplicate `collectModuleGraph`).

## False positives ruled out (matched a grep, not the pattern)

`tests/caring-contacts-migrations.test.ts`, `tests/ckb-v2-token-contract.test.ts`,
`tests/empty-catch-disposition.test.ts`, `tests/pwa-lifecycle.dom.test.tsx`,
`tests/ui-style-contract.spec.ts` — each has an unrelated local variable also named
`withoutComments`, stripping SQL or CSS comments, nothing to do with import graphs.

## What this sweep did NOT cover

- The ~1000 files never individually opened or grepped beyond the keyword passes listed above. A
  graph-walker using different vocabulary (no "queue", "entryFiles", "collectModuleGraph", and a
  filename not shaped like `*-boundary`/`*-seam`/`*-contract`/`*-guard`) would not have surfaced.
- Files under `tests/` that are Playwright specs (`*.spec.ts`) were included in the enumeration and
  keyword passes but not specifically read end-to-end for graph-walking logic, beyond the ones the
  keyword search already surfaced (`ui-style-contract.spec.ts`, ruled a false positive).
- No attempt was made to statically prove the _absence_ of a third BLIND file beyond the two found;
  this is a targeted sweep against a known defect shape, not an exhaustive proof.
