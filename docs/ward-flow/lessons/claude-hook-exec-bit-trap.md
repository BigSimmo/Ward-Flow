A new `.claude/hooks/*.sh` script added from this Windows Dev Drive workstation will be committed
**`100644`** unless someone explicitly runs `git update-index --chmod=+x <path>`. `core.fileMode`
is `false` (correct for Windows/ReFS — see [[dev-drive-project-location]]), so git ignores
filesystem permission bits and a local `chmod +x` changes nothing git can see.

**Why:** found on 2026-08-18. `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` was `100644` while
`issues-surface.sh` and `pr-handoff-stop.sh` were both `100755`. It is also the only hook
registered by **bare path** in `.claude/settings.json` rather than as `bash "..."`, and its entire
body is gated on `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` — so the one environment it does any work in is a Linux
web container, exactly where a non-executable checkout cannot run. That script provisions the Node
24 the engine floor requires; its own header names four PRs (#1611, #1697, #1705, #1740) blocked by
`npm ci` EBADENGINE before it existed.

**How to apply:**

1. After adding any hook script, run `git update-index --chmod=+x .claude/hooks/<name>.sh` and
   confirm with `git ls-files -s .claude/hooks/`.
2. Register it in `.claude/settings.json` as `bash "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/..."`, never a bare path,
   so the mode is never load-bearing.
3. `tests/session-start-hook.test.ts` now contains a `claude hook scripts are checked in runnable`
   block that fails on any hook that is not `100755` or that carries CR bytes. Do not weaken it.

Line endings are a sibling trap but currently clean: `.gitattributes` sets `* text=auto eol=lf`
and all hook blobs measured CR=0. A CR in a shell blob fails on Linux as `/bin/bash^M: bad
interpreter`. The same test pins this.
