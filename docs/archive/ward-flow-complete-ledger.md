# Ward Flow — the complete ledger, Phases 1 to 5

> **SUPERSEDED on 17 Sept 2026 by `docs/ward-flow-task-ledger.md`.** Kept for history; do not follow.

The single cross-session record of everything built. Assembled 2026-08-21 on branch
`codex/ward-management-design`, refreshed 2026-08-22, and extended on 2026-08-26 with Phase 4, the
sandbox and sidebar work, and the Phase 5 design. Ward Flow has run across many chat sessions on
several different tools, and no single conversation holds the whole picture. This file does.

**It is a map, not a replacement.** Each phase's own ledger holds the detail; this file records
what happened, in what order, where the detail lives, and what carries forward.

---

## 1. What Ward Flow is

A synthetic, offline prototype for Western Australian metro psychiatry patient flow —
coordinating a patient from a metropolitan emergency department to an inpatient psychiatric bed.
Built for a practising psychiatrist in Perth.

The problem it models, from `docs/ward-flow-context.md`: finding an inpatient bed is a
phone-around. Bed numbers are stale before they are quoted. Mental Health Act clocks are running.
Transport waits. The patient sits in the department, frequently twelve to twenty-four hours,
sometimes far longer. **Nobody holds a single current picture** of who is waiting, which beds are
genuinely allocatable, who has already declined and why, what is legally due and when, and where
the vehicle is.

**It is a prototype, not clinical decision support.** All data is synthetic. Every surface must be
verifiable against the model behind it, and must degrade to saying nothing rather than guessing.
That last rule is the one this project has repeatedly had to enforce against itself.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1     | The domain model: clock, types, eligibility gates, sites, movements; routes migrated        | 2026-08-18      | complete                  |
| 2     | The coordinator screen: pressure strip, priority queue, flow diagram, shortlist, exceptions | 2026-08-18/19   | complete                  |
| 3     | Role screens: shared state, and the ward, ED and transport-officer views                    | 2026-08-19 to — | **Tasks 1–6A of 12 done** |

### Phase 1 — the model (2026-08-18)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-ward-flow-metro-patient-flow-design.md`, plan
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-18-ward-flow-phase-1-model.md`. Handoff:
`docs/archive/ward-flow-phase-handoff.md`.

Built the injectable clock, the domain types, the eligibility gates with destination-only
authorisation, the site/unit/ED model, and a movement fixture at realistic metro pressure, then
migrated every existing route onto it. Closed with a whole-branch review pass
(`787029ae0`) and a recorded set of parked rulings (`de7b92faf`).

Key commits: `99cf00840`, `f04786309`, `b2f7cf39c`, `3cf1e89e8`, `20bdbc8f2`, `1425b38c6`,
`b2388cd64`, `f060ae763`, `cba50d8b3`, `6adab9a40`, `787029ae0`, `de7b92faf`.

### Phase 2 — the coordinator screen (2026-08-18/19)

Plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-18-ward-flow-phase-2-coordinator-screen.md`, kickoff
`docs/archive/ward-flow-phase-2-kickoff.md`.

Built the operational score (deliberately blind to clinical urgency, which orders the queue on its
own), per-department pressure, the coordinator shell, the pressure strip, the priority queue
(tier first, score within tier), the flow diagram, the explainable shortlist with verdict-stating
gates, and the exceptions drawer. Retired the Constellation view and moved mode navigation into
the rail.

Key commits: `3dbdd5e9d`, `f2b98d814`, `ef4e62c3f`, `992c3e6c7`, `ec2e59495`, `d7f5b76e2`,
`7b97608af`, `90ed4afd7`, `b8bd43dae`, `2eed0099f`, `19e9e323c`, `04cf7bc53`, `52b001af7`,
`3789eea62`.

**Phase 2's defining lesson, which set how Phase 3 has been run: its worst defects all passed
their own tests.** Several tests were unfalsifiable — `992c3e6c7` closed three of them. That is
why every test in Phase 3 is mutation-tested and every subagent claim is independently re-run.

### Phase 3 — the role screens (2026-08-19 onward, in progress)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-19-ward-flow-phase-3-role-screens-design.md` (the binding
authority, 19 sections), plan
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-19-ward-flow-phase-3-role-screens.md` (12 tasks).

**Detail lives in `docs/archive/ward-flow-phase-3-ledger.md`; state and resume steps in
`docs/archive/ward-flow-phase-3-handover.md`; every brief, report and review in
`docs/ward-flow-phase-3-workspace/`.**

| Task | Subject                                                            | State                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 1    | model and fixture                                                  | complete                          |
| 2    | the reducer                                                        | complete                          |
| 3    | the contracts                                                      | complete                          |
| 4    | provider, clock, layout                                            | complete                          |
| 5    | coordinator rewire                                                 | complete                          |
| 6    | the other nine routes                                              | complete, 5 fix rounds            |
| 6A   | the ED clock counts up                                             | complete, 2 fix rounds            |
| 7    | coordinator phone pin                                              | **next — brief + addendum ready** |
| 8–12 | ward screen, officer phone, live tracker, ED screen, role switcher | not started                       |

Task 6A is not in the original plan. It was inserted mid-phase when the clinician answered the
phase's standing open question — see §5.

## 4. Sessions, and what each one was

| Session            | Covered                                                                  | Ended by                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 sessions   | model, gates, migration, whole-branch review                             | phase completion                                  |
| Phase 2 sessions   | coordinator screen through whole-branch review                           | phase completion                                  |
| Phase 3, session 1 | plan pre-flight, Tasks 1–5, Task 6 through fix round 2                   | a monthly spend limit killed the Task 6 fix agent |
| Phase 3, session 2 | Task 6 fix rounds 3–5, Task 6A and its two fix rounds, audit and handoff | deliberate stop at the Task 6A boundary           |

Two agents were killed mid-work by hard usage ceilings across those sessions, and both left
recoverable state. That is why the handover instructs a resuming session to **inspect the working
tree before re-dispatching** — the work may be complete and merely uncommitted.

## 5. The decisions that shaped the product

Not process rulings — the ones that changed what the software says to a clinician.

**The post-examination clock counts up.** The phase carried a standing open question about what
the on-screen countdown after examination should represent. The clinician answered verbatim:
_"It is just counting how long they have been in ED determining priority. So counting up."_

The prototype had been rendering a Form 3B deadline derived from `examination.at + 240`, displayed
by seven surfaces as statutory timing and counted as a legal breach. **No such deadline exists in
the Mental Health Act.** Task 6A deleted it: `LegalForm.dueAt` is now optional, a Form 3B carries
none, absence is rendered explicitly, and an absent deadline reaching arithmetic is a compile
error.

**The four hours were real, but attached to the wrong quantity.** Spec §7 requires the
**emergency department access target** — a departmental performance measure counted up from
`openedAt`, "the number a department is judged on, and mental health patients are its largest
breachers". It survives as `ED_ACCESS_TARGET_MINUTES`, quarantined from `LegalForm`. Deleting the
fabricated deadline without noticing this would have removed a feature Task 11 requires.

**Two clocks, not one.** The spec's own rule, which the clinician's answer confirmed: the ED clock
runs from `openedAt`; the legal clock runs from `formedAt` where they differ. A patient formed in
the community at 08:00 who reaches Peel at 11:00 has already spent three hours of the examination
window.

**The screen must never claim an action it did not perform.** Phase 3's most consequential defect:
the coordinator reported a successful referral while the reducer had refused it, on nine of
eighteen movements. Fixed at three layers — the control stops advertising what it cannot do, the
confirmation is derived from the movement's own state so it is structurally incapable of lying,
and refusals surface with the reducer's own reason.

**Urgency is the clinician's judgement and is not folded into the operational score.** A number
labelled "not clinical severity" that partly was is why the previous score was deleted rather than
migrated.

## 6. Three questions raised with the clinician — two still open

None blocking; all stated rather than buried.

1. **Does the Form 1A countdown stay a countdown?** His answer was scoped to the post-examination
   case; the pre-examination examination window is still modelled as a deadline.
2. **Should being detained and examined confer priority of its own?** Today such a patient ranks
   purely on elapsed time, exactly as described — so patients still awaiting examination tend to
   rank above them.
3. **Is four hours the right ED access target for WA metro?** **Answered 2026-08-22 — no.** Four
   hours is the national figure and was never confirmed for this context; the product owner set
   the target to 24 hours (1440 minutes) for this prototype, because mental health patients breach
   four hours so routinely that it stops discriminating. `ED_ACCESS_TARGET_MINUTES` in
   `ward-model.ts` carries the current value (ruling R65(a)).

Plus one raised but undecided: **the demo now leads with an accident.** The top of the coordinator
queue is `WF-303`, a _generated_ movement whose breach comes from
`NOW_ANCHOR + (((index * 53) % 400) - 60)` — arithmetic, not authorship. Task 12's guided journey
may walk a user straight into it.

## 6b. The push, and an emptied `node_modules` whose cause is unproven

Recorded because it cost an hour, and because the honest version is more useful than the tidy one.

The branch was pushed to `origin` on 2026-08-22 at the user's request, superseding the earlier
"no push" instruction. The push succeeded. Around the same moment the local `node_modules` went to
**zero entries**, and recovery needed a full `npm ci --include=dev`.

The symptom is the part worth remembering. It was not an error about missing dependencies. It was
`tsc` reporting it could not find `process`, and 8 of 10 test files failing at once — which reads
exactly like a code regression. **`ls node_modules | wc -l` is the first check when a broad,
unexplained failure appears.**

**The cause was not established, and an earlier draft of this file asserted that it was.** The
obvious suspect is this repo's known guard-push defect — the pre-push format guard links a real
dependency tree into a scratch checkout as a Windows junction, then force-deletes the checkout —
fixed on `main` at `a04330ea0` (PR #2244), which is not an ancestor of this branch. But both
force-deletes were probed directly on this machine and **neither destroyed the junction's target**:
Node's recursive `rmSync` did not follow the junction, and neither did `git worktree remove
--force`. A live alternative is that `findPrettierBin` borrows _another_ worktree's tree when this
one has none, and this repo has dozens of sibling worktrees.

A hand-written fix was drafted onto this branch and then **reverted**. The mutation test settled
it: reintroducing the supposed bug on purpose failed no test at all, which proves the fix was
untestable against an unknown mechanism. Shipping it would have been a guard that claims more than
it delivers — the exact defect class §7 is about, committed while documenting §7. The correct route
is bringing `main` into this branch, which carries the reviewed upstream fix; that is a real piece
of work with conflict risk and is the user's call.

## 7. The recurring failure, across all three phases

One defect class has appeared in every phase, in a different disguise each time:

- **Phase 1** shipped a privacy guard that checked properties and never read strings.
- **Phase 2** shipped three unfalsifiable tests; its worst defects all passed their own tests.
- **Phase 3, Task 1** shipped a privacy guard whose loops executed zero times.
- **Phase 3, Task 3** shipped two vacuous invariants asserting against fixture state, not walk state.
- **Phase 3, Task 5** shipped a Playwright test asserting `/refus/i` against empty-state copy that
  contained the word.
- **Phase 3, Task 6** spent three of five fix rounds on one static guard that overclaimed in three
  successive forms — co-occurrence scoping, directory scoping, and a hand-rolled scanner blinded by
  a quote inside a regex literal.
- **Phase 3, Task 6A** found the same shape a fourth time in a new guard, and answered it
  differently: **narrow the claim rather than chase completeness**, and move real enforcement into
  the brief and review of the task that will exercise it.

**The lesson, and it is this project's most important finding: a check that claims more than it
delivers is worse than no check, because it stops anyone looking harder.** Every one of those was
found by someone deliberately trying to defeat the check — never by running it.

The practice that follows: mutation-test every test, print the edited line back from the file
before trusting the run, re-run every subagent's gates independently, and read counts rather than
the word "passed".

## 5b. Phase 4 — specialist boards (2026-08-25)

Branch `claude/ward-flow-phase-4-spec`, PR #2373. Eleven of twelve planned items delivered; item
twelve, a statutory clock board, was deliberately **held** because building it requires stating
figures from the Mental Health Act, and no agent may state, paraphrase or infer one.

Delivered: the handover board, the escalation board, patient search, the role switcher that walks
one movement through all four roles without a reload, the demo clock and scenario reset, capacity
columns for sex mix / specialling / authorisation, bed releases with a fixed blocker list, the
change audit, and the effectiveness numbers with the third measure explicitly dropped and said so
on the page.

Two of the phase's own claims were **corrected in the spec after the fact**, both wrong in the same
direction — a measurement taken from a function that truncates its input. The eligible-ward
distribution is `{0:2, 4:11, 5:6, 6:3, 11:1, 12:9, 14:9}` over 337 eligible pairs, with WF-009 and
WF-308 stranded. A subagent's test contradicted the original figure and was right.

Binding spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-25-ward-flow-phase-4-specialist-boards-design.md`.
Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-25-ward-flow-phase-4-specialist-boards.md`. Note that
Prettier never converges on that plan file — two `--write` passes leave thirty lines differing — so
a format guard on it is expected to need `SKIP_FORMAT_GUARD=1`, and that is documented rather than
worked around.

## 5c. The sandbox move and the sidebar (2026-08-26)

**Ward Flow became a genuine sandbox.** It now lives at `/mockups/ward-flow`, behind the
administrator-only developer gate, following the pattern Caring Contacts and Care Plan already use.
Nine links out of it into the clinical application were removed — and then a tenth, the logo, which
pointed at the site root and which no amount of source reading had caught. It was found by looking
at a screenshot. The header also read "Clinical KB / Source-backed clinical search" on every board
of a prototype that does no searching and is not source-backed; it now reads "Ward Flow / Synthetic
patient-flow prototype". `tests/ward-nav.test.ts` guards both, and its forbidden-exit list includes
`/` for exactly this reason.

**The sidebar was rebuilt to the repository's house pattern.** Before this it had one state:
`ward-management.module.css` held four media queries, of which two were `prefers-reduced-motion` and
`forced-colors` and two named `.workspaceGrid` and `.patientWorkspace`. Not one touched the rail, so
a 390px phone rendered the full 4.5rem desktop icon column — 18% of the viewport — on every screen,
through 38 test files and 428 passing tests, because nothing was structurally wrong.

It now has the three shapes `ClinicalSidebar.tsx` uses: a drawer below 40rem, the icon rail from
40rem, and an optional 17rem labelled panel from 64rem whose collapsed state persists per browser.
Nine of the ten Ward Flow shells are a bare rail-plus-main grid with **no header row at all**, so
unlike the clinical application there was nowhere for a drawer trigger to live — the sidebar brings
its own fixed phone bar, which is also the first phone chrome those nine screens have ever had.

The eight mode views moved out of eight hand-written link blocks into `WARD_VIEWS` in `ward-nav.ts`.
A labelled panel cannot read a rail's icon-only JSX, and copying them would have re-created the
two-lists-drifting defect (D8/D9) that file exists to prevent.

**Three lessons from that day, recorded because they cost real time:**

1. A phone-contract check passed with the very rule it guarded deleted, because its assertion
   substring also matched a qualified selector further down the same stylesheet. Found by mutation,
   not by reading.
2. Two sessions worked the identical task in one worktree folder: a merge with conflicts, and an
   edit to a test that broke it in a way only a browser run could find. **One session per folder,
   and no two sessions aimed at the same pull request.**
3. `node scripts/run-playwright.mjs` exits `0` when tests fail and when it refuses to run at all.
   Read the `N passed` line; never the exit code.

## 5d. Phase 5 — designed and BUILT 2026-08-26

Direction settled across one long conversation: Ward Flow becomes a bed-flow hub covering the whole
pipe, from the community mental health team's decision to admit through to discharge — not the
ED-to-ward segment it models today.

Sixteen decisions are recorded in `docs/archive/ward-flow-roadmap.md`, which is the durable statement of
direction and should not be re-litigated without instruction. Phase 5 itself is bed availability and
nothing else: a lifecycle for a bed release, leave beds, a discharge board, predicted capacity for
today in four bands ending at 22:00, and a freshness stamp on every screen.

Binding spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-ward-flow-phase-5-bed-availability-design.md`.
Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-26-ward-flow-phase-5-bed-availability.md`.
Cold-start handover: `docs/ward-flow-phase-5-handover.md`.

**The assumption most likely to be wrong**, recorded as spec D14: predicted, confirmed, blocked,
released is a software model of how a bed comes free, and no ward clinician has checked it. A bed
may be confirmed and blocked simultaneously in reality. It is cheap to change while synthetic.

### What was built, 2026-08-26

Eight tasks, subagent-driven, one implementer per task with an independent review after each.

- A bed release gained the lifecycle. `confidence` narrowed to `likely | possible` and now means
  something only while a release is predicted; `blocker` became state-dependent and typed, legal
  only while blocked. `LeaveBed` is its own type and a usable leave bed is never merged into
  availability. The blocker list grew to seven, all operational, none describing a person.
- Five capacity figures, derived in one place. `availableNow` is computed before any release or
  leave bed is looked at, so a prediction is **structurally** incapable of inflating it — not
  merely tested against, unable to happen. `availableNow` and `held` are copied verbatim from
  `unitCapacity` so the number a coordinator acts on cannot drift.
- Only a ward moves its own beds. A coordinator attempting any transition gets a visible
  `Rejection`; the one thing it may do — request a refresh — changes no number.
- The discharge and egress board at `/mockups/ward-flow/discharges`, blocked rows first, cards
  rather than a squeezed table below 40rem, and the beyond-tonight exclusion count stated even at
  zero.
- One freshness stamp, used by every board.

**The boundary went 22:00 → 24:00 → 22:00** in one session. The owner asked for midnight; on being
shown D5's reasoning (midnight is a calendar boundary, nobody hands over at midnight) they reverted.
The spec is byte-identical to what it was. Recorded because the round trip is the useful part: D5
had written the boundary down "so it can be changed in one place", and that is exactly how it
behaved — one constant, one assertion, no code shipped at the wrong value.

### What the screenshots caught that every test passed

The sweep ran after the first visible change rather than at the end, and found four defects that
were invisible to 10,000+ passing tests. This is section 7's recurring failure, caught mid-phase for
the first time instead of after later work was built on top:

1. The discharge board printed each confirming ward twice per row — a bare line above the freshness
   stamp that already names it. Same class as the Phase 4 sidebar that duplicated its own title.
2. **The capacity board contradicted its own headline.** The headline carefully separates confirmed
   from predicted and excludes beyond-tonight; the per-unit row three columns away still showed
   `potential`, which lumps all of it together including the excluded ones. One screen, two
   incompatible answers.
3. A raw union value rendered as user-facing text — a release read `confirmed` in lowercase.
4. Fixing (2) exposed a fourth: the ward screen still said "Potential 1" for the same unit the
   capacity board now described as "Confirmed 1, Predicted 0", directly above an itemised list
   showing that release as Confirmed. Two vocabularies for the same beds.

Each fix carries an assertion that would catch its return, and each was mutation-tested.

### Two gates that hid, and one pre-existing failure

- **Formatting is in none of `test`, `typecheck` or `lint`.** Five files were unformatted after all
  three passed. Nothing verified during the phase could have caught it; only CI would have.
- **The legal-figure guard failed the build, correctly.** `candidateEvents` must switch
  exhaustively over every event type, so adding six events without extending
  `tests/ward-legal-figure-guard.test.ts` refused to compile rather than letting six actions pass
  through the Mental Health Act sweep unchecked. Extended, and proven non-vacuous by emptying one
  candidate list and watching the traversal assertion name the event that stopped being reached.
- Three failures in `clinical-hazard-controls`, `privacy-readiness-contract` and
  `rag-plan-package-parity` fail identically on clean `origin/main` — verified in a worktree at
  that ref. Pre-existing, unrelated to Ward Flow, deliberately not touched.

### Still true after Phase 5

Not one new fact about any patient entered the system. `BedRelease` and `LeaveBed` both remain free
of anything describing a person, asserted structurally against each type's own field set rather
than against fixture content — a future field named `patientId` would fail it. No legal figure was
invented anywhere.

### 5d-ii. Automated review round, and the role-screen flake it uncovered (2026-08-26)

Four findings were raised against PR #2390 by automated review after the phase was assembled.
Three were real and are fixed; one was rejected. All three fixes carry a new test that was
mutation-tested — the guarded behaviour was deliberately broken, the test watched to go red with
the failure line quoted, then restored.

1. **P1 — every ward-entered prediction landed in the wrong band.** `FLAG_BED_RELEASE` carried no
   expected time, so the reducer stamped `expectedAt` with the moment the ward _reported_ the
   release. `releaseBand()` then classified it `now` every time, because `expectedAt <= now` is
   trivially true when the two are equal. The four planning bands therefore worked only for the
   hand-authored fixture and never for anything a ward actually flagged — the single most
   consequential defect found in the phase. Fixed by collecting an "Expected free" time on the
   ward's flag form, parsed by the same helper the leave-bed form already uses, and carrying it
   through unchanged. `confirmedAt` deliberately stays the moment of the report: they are
   different facts, and conflating them was the bug. Neither carries anything about the departing
   patient — `expectedAt` is an operational estimate about the **bed**, the same category
   `expectedReturn` already occupies.
2. **P2 — leave-bed identifiers collided, and ending one deleted two.** The identifier was derived
   from the array's length, but ending a leave bed _removes_ an entry. Record two, end the first,
   record a third, and the third is handed the first's identifier back; the removal filter then
   deletes both. Fixed with a monotonic sequence that only ever increases, mirroring the existing
   referral sequence. Bed releases were checked for the same flaw and do **not** have it: nothing
   ever removes a release, so its length-derived identifier is safe — that reasoning is now a
   comment on the identifier itself so nobody has to re-derive it.
3. **P2 — the freshness stamp reported the wrong time after a transition.** Confirming, blocking
   and releasing all spread the existing record and kept the original `confirmedAt`, so a row went
   on reporting when it was first flagged rather than when its current state became true — which
   defeats the whole point of spec D7. All three now restate `confirmedAt`. `confirmedBy` is
   deliberately left alone: each case already refuses any acting unit other than the release's own
   ward, so it can only ever be rewritten to the identical string.
4. **P2 — rejected in its original form, then implemented narrowly, and SHIPPED.** The reviewer
   originally wanted a released bed to stop banding `now` once the clock passes the day boundary. That value feeds the discharge board's
   excluded count, whose footer reads "expected beyond tonight" — and a bed that has already been
   released is not _expected_ at any future time. The fix would have traded a cosmetic ordering nit
   for a board making a false statement about a real record, reachable in three clicks of the demo
   clock.

   **Corrected 2026-08-27 — the premise recorded here was wrong, and the finding was ultimately
   implemented.** The claim was that "there is no next operating day in this prototype, so
   'Released today' never needs to empty". The demo clock does roll across operating days, and
   advancing it by one was still listing yesterday's released beds under "Released today". Before
   merge the finding was re-implemented in a narrower form and shipped: a released record bands
   `beyond-today` only when its `confirmedAt` falls on an earlier operating day than `now`. Same-day
   released beds still band `now`. The board's footer objection is answered because the carried-over
   row joins the exclusion count that is already stated aloud, rather than being silently dropped.
   Spec D1 is not weakened either way: `capacityBreakdown()` skips released records before it
   derives any figure, so `availableNow` never saw them. Scope is the discharge board's display
   only. Recorded here because a later session will meet this code and **should not revert it**
   back to an unconditional `now`.

**The role-screen browser flake is pre-existing and is not Phase 5's.** `tests/ui-ward-roles.spec.ts`
intermittently fails with a Playwright strict-mode violation — a role screen's own test identifier
resolving to two elements rather than one. Measured deliberately, on a quiet tree, against the
isolated production server the runner builds:

| Ref                 | Runs | Failing runs | Signature                                 |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| This branch         | 3    | 1            | `ward-unit-screen` resolved to 2 elements |
| Clean `origin/main` | 7    | 1            | `ward-ed-screen` resolved to 2 elements   |

The identical failure class reproduces on `origin/main`, on the **emergency department** screen,
which Phase 5 does not touch in any way — and `tests/ui-ward-roles.spec.ts` is byte-identical
between the two refs. So the mechanism is generic to the ward-flow role screens rather than
anything Phase 5 introduced. Both render sites of each identifier are mutually exclusive branches
of a single early `return`, so two elements can only mean two component instances or streamed
markup briefly present in the document at once; that mechanism is **not yet established**, and
saying otherwise would be a guess.

Honest caveat on the numbers: 1-in-3 against 1-in-7 is too small a sample to claim Phase 5 made it
either more or less frequent. The attribution that _is_ safe is the one that matters — it happens
without Phase 5's code.

Nothing was quarantined, skipped or loosened. The repository's flake policy requires three
reproductions on the same commit before quarantine, which has not happened, and the assertion is
correct as written: the screen genuinely should appear once. Captured for a later session rather
than papered over here.

### 5d-iii. Final whole-branch review (2026-08-26)

One review covered the whole branch and stood in for the per-task reviews of Tasks 5, 6 and 7 and
both visual-fix rounds, which were deliberately deferred into it. Verdict: **approved with
findings — no P0, no P1, seven P2.** All seven are fixed, each with a new or strengthened test that
was mutation-tested.

What it confirmed, rather than assumed, is worth recording because these are the phase's own
promises:

- **Nothing predicted, confirmed-but-unreleased or on leave can reach "available now".** The
  reviewer traced every producer and every one of the eight consumers rather than trusting the
  comments. `availableNow` is computed before any release or leave bed is examined, so this is
  structural blindness rather than arithmetic that merely happens to agree today. The only door by
  which a release ever moves an availability number is the terminal `released` transition, which is
  what spec D1 defines as the bed actually being free, and it is clamped to the unit's bed total.
- **No patient attribute, identifying timing or free text reached `BedRelease` or `LeaveBed`.**
  Both field sets are exactly the spec's, neither carries sex, and every `confirmedBy` is a role
  string the caller cannot supply.
- **The `expectedAt` field added during the review round is a fact about the bed and should stay.**
  It is mandated by spec D1 and D5 rather than invented; the four planning bands are underivable
  without it; the record carries no key of any kind linking it to a person; and it sits below the
  bar spec D4 already set for a leave bed's expected return. The network-wide board renders a band,
  never the instant — only the owning ward, which already knows who is in the bed, sees the time.

The seven fixed findings, in the order they were worked:

1. The ward screen's chip read `Leave` while counting only _usable_ leave beds, so one screen
   contradicted itself twice over on seeded data. Now `Leave (usable)`, matching spec D6 and the
   capacity board.
2. A `Potential` chip on the network view and the coordinator flow diagram still counted every
   release regardless of state or timing — advertising an **already released** bed as "may become
   available", with no clicks, on seeded data. Both surfaces now read the same Confirmed/Predicted
   breakdown the capacity board and ward screen already use. `unitCapacity()`'s arithmetic is
   untouched.
3. `blocker` was still an unconstrained `string` at every layer that spec D3 says must constrain it,
   and the reducer's guard was a truthiness test rather than a membership test. Both tightened.
4. The capacity board asserted a confirming ward unconditionally, so spec D7's "Never confirmed"
   floor was unreachable and a ward could be credited with confirming a figure it never confirmed.
   It now carries the same guarded props the ward screen already had.
5. The leave bed's only structural privacy guard inspected one hand-authored fixture object, so
   adding an optional `sex` field to `LeaveBed` would have passed the whole suite. It now asserts
   the allowed field set over every seeded record **and** one the reducer produced.
6. A freshness test's regex accepted both possible outputs, so it could not fail for the behaviour
   its own title claimed. Pinned to the exact string.
7. Releasing a bed lowered derived occupancy without touching the sex-mix figure, which every other
   occupancy-changing event maintains — so the capacity board's own row contradicted itself three
   clicks in. Sex was **not** added to `BedRelease` (spec D11 forbids it) and no sex was guessed at:
   the model genuinely cannot know who left, so the cell now says so in visible words when the two
   no longer agree. Saying less is the phase's stated failure behaviour.

**Follow-up the review found and this phase did not close.** Spec D9 says the discharge board is
reached "from the sidebar's Boards group **and from the capacity board's own figures**". Only the
sidebar entry exists. That is an unimplemented spec clause rather than a defect, and it is small —
worth doing at the start of Phase 6 while the numbers are fresh.

**Third observation on the role-screen flake, and it narrows the cause.** Running three ward specs
in one invocation, the same strict-mode duplicate-element failure struck the _discharge_ journey's
own `ward-unit-screen` assertion; the same spec then passed twice in a row immediately afterwards.
So the condition has now been seen on three different identifiers across two refs. What every
instance shares is the shape of the assertion, not the screen: an expectation placed immediately
after `page.goto(..., { waitUntil: "domcontentloaded" })`, and it is likelier under load. That is
consistent with streamed markup being briefly present in the document twice — but consistent is not
established, and the mechanism is still unproven. Nothing was quarantined, skipped or loosened.
