# The orchestrator chat — what it is, and what it must never become

> **SUPERSEDED on 17 Sept 2026 by `docs/ward-flow/HOW-WE-WORK.md`.** Kept for history; do not follow. The orchestrator, builder and verifier roles were retired on 15 Sept (owner-decisions-2026-09-15).

**Owner decision, 2026-08-30:** the rules/process chat becomes the **orchestrator**, tracking the
other four, coordinating them, and ensuring nothing is missed, overlooked, duplicated or destroyed.

**This document is written against the ways an orchestrator fails, not the ways it helps.** The
helping is obvious. The failures are not, and every one of them happened in some form on 29–30 August
before the role existed.

---

## 1. The three ways this role goes wrong

### 1.1 It becomes the single stale picture everyone trusts

**An orchestrator's view is derived from other sessions' reports, so it decays faster than anyone
else's** — and it is the view that most people act on without re-checking.

On 29–30 August, this chat's picture was wrong about: which branch the board session was on, whether
a fold had happened, whether a task was done, whether a document had landed, whether a worktree was
free. **Every one was corrected by another chat measuring rather than trusting.**

> **The rule: measure, never recall. Publish the command with the answer so anyone can re-run it.**
> A status this chat cannot show its working for is a rumour with a title.

**The sharper version, from the build session:** this chat's view **decays fastest AND is checked
least**, because _a status from a coordinating chat reads as already-verified._ **Everyone else's
claims get re-measured; this chat's get quoted.** The fastest-rotting statement in the project is the
one nobody re-runs.

**So every observation carries its SHA or its timestamp.** _"Clean as of these two SHAs"_, never
_"clean"_. _"dirty=0 at 01:52"_, never _"FREE"_. **Four errors on 29–30 August were true measurements
quoted after they expired** — a lock table, an empty agent output file, a `git status` sampled
between mutation steps, and a fold that stopped being a fast-forward inside four minutes. **None was
a wrong reading.**

**And the companion rule, from the untangle session: ask what an instrument would show IF IT WERE NOT
WORKING, before treating a reading as evidence.** In each of those, **the failure signature and the
reassuring signature were the same string.**

**The clearest example is this chat's own:** a test matrix for the protection hook reported **every
case passing** — because `bash` could not find the hook and produced no output to match against.
**It measured nothing and returned the shape of total success.** The other three at least measured
something.

### A session's ADDRESS is not stable, and a written list of them decays silently

**2026-08-30. The owner renamed two chats; the rename moved the messaging address, not just the
label.** A message to the old address fails, **and a failed send is the only signal** — there is no
bounce that explains itself.

**This bit the orchestrator first and hardest**, because it is the one chat likely to hold a written
list of who-to-message. **My own address changed without my knowing**, and a peer's message to me had
already bounced before anyone worked out why.

> **A name in a document is a hypothesis. The listing is the world.**

**So `ListAgents` goes beside the answer, exactly as `git` goes beside a claim about a branch.** Same
rule, different subject: **measure, never recall.**

**One correction to the version I was given, found by running it:** the listing is **not** entirely
silent about a rename — it annotates a recently renamed session (_"says it was X until 51s ago"_).
**So the mechanism does announce itself, briefly, in the one place nobody looks unless they already
suspect.** That is worth knowing precisely: **the signal exists and is short-lived, which is worse
than absent, because a document written an hour later carries no trace of it.**

**Addresses are therefore recorded nowhere durable.** This charter names ROLES; the ownership
registry names WORKTREES and BRANCHES. **Both are stable. Addresses are not, and putting them in a
document is how the document becomes wrong without changing.**

#### The protocol has exactly one holder

**Nobody can warn that someone else's address has moved — but the RENAMED session can, because the
listing annotates its own rename while the annotation lasts.**

> **The renamed session announces. Nobody else can, and nobody else should try.**

**The build session did exactly that within a minute of being told, which is the only reason a
confirming listing had a name to confirm.** When this chat was renamed and did not, the board
session's first indication was **a bounce with no cause** — and neither party could diagnose it,
because the only session that could have was the one that did not know to look.

**And the corollary, which must be stated positively or it will be misread:** **the absence of an
announcement means nothing at all, in either direction.** The only two reliable signals are **a
session announcing its own rename**, and **a send that fails.**

#### A signal that expires is worse than no signal

**The listing's rename annotation lasts under a minute, in a place nobody looks unless they already
suspect.** So **anyone reconstructing the event an hour later finds no trace and reasonably concludes
there was nothing to see.**

> **It manufactures false confidence in exactly the reader who is being careful.**

**This is the fifth member of the family and the only TEMPORAL one.** The other four fail
structurally — a zero-byte output file, a `git status` sampled between mutation steps, a CR count
returning the line count, two agreeing greps with one blind spot. **Here the right reading existed
and was simply not available when anyone needed it.** In all five, **the instrument's failure looks
identical to its success.**

### Two readers of the same sentence are not two instruments

**The referrals session, 2026-08-30, declining to bank a reading I had told it I agreed with:**

> _"Two of us independently reaching the same reading is worth something, but we have both read the
> same three sentences of his, so we are not independent instruments in the way that counts."_

**This is the shared-blind-spot rule applied to INTERPRETATION rather than to search.** Two greps
that share a glob agree because the glob is wrong. **Two readers who share a source agree because the
source is ambiguous** — and agreement tells you nothing about which reading is right, only that the
sentence supports both.

**The test is the same one: could the two checks have disagreed?** Two people reading the same three
sentences **could** disagree, but their agreement is weak evidence, because **the thing that would
settle it — what the author meant — was never consulted by either.**

**And the remedy is not more readers. It is the author.**

### When a reading is uncertain, choose by the ASYMMETRY of being wrong

**Same exchange, and it is the best decision procedure anyone has used tonight.** The owner said
community hubs are _"the same as the previous two"_ — which answers **what shape** they are, and does
not obviously reverse his earlier _"leave the community part for now."_

**The session did not weigh which reading was likelier. It weighed the cost of each error:**

- **Read it cautiously and be wrong:** community hubs arrive later than he expects.
- **Read it eagerly and be wrong:** **screens get built for teams that do not exist and cannot
  receive anything.**

> **The second is much worse, so it defaulted to the cautious reading — and said so to him plainly
> rather than silently.**

**That last clause is what makes it a method rather than timidity.** A cautious default chosen
silently is indistinguishable from having missed the instruction.

### A hedge is only load-bearing if it names WHICH failure mode is suspected

**The ledger session's rule, 2026-08-30, and the cheapest safeguard on this list.**

It reported that it could not find a referral cap, **and named the specific way it might be wrong**:
_"my check may be narrower than the question, and a plausible origin for the number is sitting three
lines from the referral validation."_ **One command settled it. Nothing had to be unwound.**

> **_"I might be wrong"_ buys nothing — it is politeness, and a reader discounts it. _"My pattern may
> be narrower than the question, and here is the specific wrong thing I may have matched"_ tells the
> reader exactly which command resolves it.**

**And it is the REMEDY for the shared-blind-spot rule above, which until now was a problem with no
fix.** Two checks that share a blind spot retire the doubt rather than testing it. **A declared
failure mode is exactly what makes the second check independent — because it tells the second checker
what not to reuse.** One rule says _"two of us checked" is not evidence unless the checks could have
disagreed_; this one is how you make them able to.

### The fourth way a search returns a confident wrong answer: hunting a guessed name

**`MAX_REFERRAL*`, `REFERRAL_LIMIT`, `MAX_UNITS` — every guess returned a clean nothing.** The
constant is called `PARALLEL_REFERRAL_CAP`.

> **A guessed identifier that does not exist is indistinguishable from an absent feature.**

**Find a declaration by its VALUE or its USE SITE, never by the name you would have chosen for it.**
Distinct from the other three: not a pattern too narrow, not a scope too wide, not the right pattern
on the wrong object — **a search for something that was never there to find.**

### And the guard on the owner's hardest rule already defends against all of it

**Worth recording as the positive case, because a register of only failures teaches that the rules
are a tax.** `tests/ward-legal-figure-guard.test.ts` protects the standing refusal against inventing
any Mental Health Act figure. Checked at the working line:

- **It records the cap's provenance** — _"product owner's spec … count of units, not a duration"_ —
  and its comment says **"an operational courtesy limit between services, explicitly NOT a clinical
  or statutory quantity."** So **three has been deliberately distinguished from a legal threshold**,
  and that test is the answer if anyone ever asks whether Ward Flow invented one.
- **And it checks its own instrument.** Before trusting its scan it asserts the scan produced
  identifiers at all, with the comment: _"their absence means the scan itself is broken, not that the
  code is clean."_

**That is this whole document's governing failure, defended against, inside the guard on the owner's
most absolute rule, written before any of today's findings.** Somebody had already worked out that an
empty result and a clean result are different things.

### A half-built change looks exactly like a backwards one — and re-searching only confirms it

**Found by the ledger session, 2026-08-30, in a decision of mine. Verified here.**

`FD-8` — my own seam ruling — says: **the referral carries the tentative diagnosis block at intake;
the admission inherits it.** On the working line:

```
tentativeDiagnosis appears in FIVE files, every one admission-side:
  ward-admissions.ts   ward-admissions-seed.ts   ward-diagnosis.ts
  board/ward-board.tsx board/ward-daily-sheet.tsx
Referral / ReferralDraft carry NONE.
```

**The admission authors the fact. The referral has nothing to inherit from. The direction is
reversed.**

> **And a grep for the decision's own vocabulary returns five confident hits and certifies it
> implemented.** Every symbol the decision names is present, the constant exists, the screens render
> it. **The only missing property is the direction of the arrow — and direction is the one thing a
> name search cannot see.**

**CORRECTED 2026-08-30, and the correction is worth more than the finding was.**

**`FD-8` is NOT built backwards. It is HALF BUILT, and the commit that did the half says so:**
`f20b8087b` — _"the diagnosis vocabulary moved where a referral can reach it."_ **The move to
`ward-diagnosis.ts` was preparation for the referral to use it**, not the admission claiming
ownership. The referral session caught this; the ledger session, which reported it, accepted the
correction.

**So the real lesson is harder than the one I recorded, and it is not another narrow search.**

> **Mid-flight work has the exact shape of a wrong build.** A half-finished change looks identical to
> a finished change pointing the wrong way — the symbols exist, they sit on one side, and **nothing in
> the tree says the other half is assigned to somebody.**

**And this is why it is worse than the four search failures beside it: re-running the search only
confirms it.** Every one of those had a different pattern that would have exposed it. **Here the
search was correct and the inference was wrong** — intent read from a snapshot of work in motion.

> **Remedy: for any _"why is this like this"_ question, read the LOG, not the tree.** The tree shows a
> state; only the history shows a direction of travel. `git log` was the wrong instrument for
> "has this shipped" and is the right one for "is this going somewhere".

**What survives from the original finding, because it is still true:** _which record declares the
field_ is a question about a **definition**, answered by opening the type — never by counting
occurrences. **The instance was wrong; the instrument advice was right.**

**And the near-miss beside it stands:** the ledger session first checked on its own branch, which
does not carry the work, **and nearly reported that nothing was built at all.** The same instrument,
pointed at the wrong ref, produced a confident answer in the opposite direction.

### Any `N/N` names its units — the rename diffstat wears the shape of a green suite

**Caught by the ledger session, 2026-08-30, in my own message.** I reported a rename as
_"23 files, 91/91, verified here"_. **It read that as 91 of 91 tests passing.** The diffstat is:

```
23 files changed, 91 insertions(+), 91 deletions(-)
```

**And a pure rename produces equal insertions and deletions BY CONSTRUCTION.** So the ratio is
guaranteed by the operation, **carries no information whatsoever**, and **wears the exact shape of
the strongest evidence a session can offer.**

**For the record: I did not run the suite. `91/91` was the diffstat, and no test figure of mine
exists for that commit.**

> **Rule: any `N/N` names its units — `91 tests` or `+91/−91 lines`. Never the bare pair.**

**Why this is worse than a slip and belongs in a charter rather than an apology: it is
deterministic.** Every rename any session reports from now on produces a number pair that looks like
green tests, **because a rename that changed a different number of lines each way would be a rename
that changed something else.** The most reassuring-looking figure available is the one that is
guaranteed in advance.

### Agreement between two checks is not confirmation when both are bent the same way

**The strongest instance of the day's theme, and it is the ledger session's framing.**

Two sessions independently listed the files affected by a rename. **Both globbed `ward-*`. The
browser journeys are named `ui-ward-*`.** So both lists missed the same file, **and their agreement
read as confirmation.**

> **A second check that shares the first's blind spot RETIRES the doubt rather than testing it.**
> That is materially worse than a single narrow check, which at least leaves the question open.

**The tell is that neither session was careless** — both instruments were bent the same way by a
naming convention neither had reason to question. **So "two of us checked" is not evidence unless the
two checks could have disagreed.**

### A finding can survive a careless check by looking like its own refutation

**Same day.** The unpinned button label: `ward-screen.tsx` renders `Discharged` and **nothing pins
it.** But `tests/ward-discharge-board.dom.test.tsx` **does** pin visible text — the group headings
`["Blocked", "Confirmed", "Predicted", "Discharged today"]`, in exact order.

**So anyone asking "is this vocabulary covered?" finds a passing assertion on those exact words and
concludes the label is fine.** The evidence that looks like a refutation is real, passing, and about
a different surface.

**And the population is unknown: one unpinned string found is not one unpinned string existing.
Nobody has counted.**

### "Unless that has changed" is not a hedge — it is an unfalsifiable claim

**Caught by the build session within the hour of failure mode 1 being written down.** I told a chat
it held a worktree _"unless that has changed"_. **It had changed** — the tree had been handed on
before my message arrived — and if anyone had acted on the row, two sessions would have been in one
tree.

**The row was true when written. The hedge is what made it useless.**

> _**"Unless that has changed" puts the checking on the reader without giving them anything to check
> against.**_

**A hedge that names no reference point cannot be evaluated by anybody.** It reads as caution and
functions as an excuse in advance — the writer is covered, and the reader is no better off than with
a flat assertion, because they cannot tell WHICH part might have moved or WHEN it was true.

**The form that works:** _"yours at `a3d199fa7`, as of 02:31."_ **A reader can see for themselves
whether it has expired.** The hedge is the SHA and the timestamp, not the word "unless".

**And the general form, since it applies past this role:** **a caveat that cannot be checked is not a
caveat.** If a qualifier does not tell the reader what to measure, it protects the author and nobody
else.

### And the opposite error: BEHIND is not STALE

**Caught by the board session within minutes of this role starting.** I told it that its test results
and every figure in its commit messages were stale because the clock had landed elsewhere. **They
were not.**

> **77 files / 1171 tests / exit 0 was measured ON `f20b8087b` and remains exactly true OF
> `f20b8087b`.** A measurement of your own tree does not expire because somebody committed on another
> line.

**What is genuinely unknown is the MERGED tree** — which that run never claimed to describe. **Track
it as "merged result unknown", never as "their numbers went stale".**

**And the reason this matters to a coordinator more than to anyone else:** if being behind marks
results stale, **every result in the project is stale almost always, and the word stops selecting
anything.** A warning that fires constantly is not a warning.

**The useful question is not "is this session behind" but "has anything it measured been touched by
what it is behind."** The board session checked exactly that — two of the four commits touch the file
its conclusion rested on, and the rule it depended on was unchanged — so the conclusion survives.
**That is the check a coordinator should ask for, rather than issuing a blanket staleness warning.**

### 1.2 It becomes an authority-laundering channel

**The owner speaks to one chat; that chat tells the orchestrator; the orchestrator tells everyone
else — and by the third hop it sounds like a decision rather than a report.**

Two chats refused this chat's relays on 29–30 August and **both were right to.** One refused when
refusing was harder; one refused when acting would have been easier.

> **The rule: this chat has NO authority it did not have yesterday.** It sequences, tracks and warns.
> **It never authorises.** Every relayed instruction is labelled as a relay, in the message, every
> time. **A chat that refuses a relay from the orchestrator is doing its job, not obstructing.**

### 1.3 It becomes a bottleneck, and then a bypass

**If everything must route through one chat, work stalls whenever that chat is busy — and sessions
route around it, which is worse than never having had it**, because the registry then looks
authoritative and is not.

> **The rule: chats talk DIRECTLY to each other for anything that concerns two chats.** The
> orchestrator is copied, not consulted. It is consulted only for sequencing across three or more, or
> when nobody owns something.

---

### 1.4 It keeps ONE state column for a thing that has several

**Named by the board session, 2026-08-30, from an argument it had with the ledger session in which
both were accurate.**

**For about an hour, a defect was simultaneously fixed on one branch and live on the line everyone
reads.** Two sessions disagreed about whether it was closed, **and neither was wrong** — they were
describing different refs.

> **A finding's state is PER-REF until it reaches the working line. One OPEN/CLOSED column cannot
> express that, and this board is where it will happen most.**

**So a finding is tracked as `fixed on <ref>` and `live on <ref>` until those agree.** "Closed" means
**closed on the working line** and nothing else. **The ledger session marked exactly this defect
closed on the strength of a fix existing somewhere**, which is the failure this rule prevents — and
it is the documentary twin of DECIDED-versus-IMPLEMENTED.

---

### 1.5 It becomes a second register of record, without anyone deciding to

**THE LEDGER IS THE REGISTER OF RECORD. THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT, AND MUST NEVER BECOME ONE.**

- **`docs/ward-flow-ledger.md` holds decision identity and status.** It is the register of record.
- **This chat holds sequencing and reasoning.** **An orchestrator is not a second ledger.**
- **If this chat ever starts recording status rather than pointing at the ledger's, that is the
  breach**, and any chat noticing it should say so.

**Why this is written HERE rather than trusted to a message between two sessions** — which is where I
first put it, and where the ledger session caught it:

**The orchestrator accretes status by its nature.** Assembling a picture from four sessions and
publishing it **is a register in everything but name**, and nothing about doing it feels like opening
a second register at the time. **That is exactly how two decision registers existed on 29 August —
neither created by a decision to create one.** The rule against it was written, and broken hours
later by the session that had written it, **because a session working alone with a clear idea writes
the natural document for that idea, and the idea supplies no signal that anyone else is having it.**

**A constraint that lives in someone else's inbox will not fire at the moment it is needed. A pointer
to a boundary is not a boundary** — the reader about to breach it is precisely the reader who will
not follow the link.

### The asymmetry that produced the gap, kept because it will recur

**The constraint that COSTS this chat something — _"it never authorises"_ — went into the durable
document. The constraint that reads as DEFERENCE — _"the ledger remains the register of record"_ —
went into a message, which does not outlive the session.**

Not deliberate, and that is the point. **The finding you are pleased with is the one you check last**,
and a sentence that makes you look appropriately humble feels finished the moment it is written.

> **Test for any constraint on yourself: is it in the artefact that persists, or only in the place
> where saying it felt good?**

---

## 2. What the orchestrator actually does

1. **Holds the live registry** — who owns what, who holds the baton, what is in flight — **built from
   what sessions have said, never from what directories look like.**
2. **Sequences work** and keeps the master sequence honest, including deleting from it the moment
   something lands.
3. **Detects collisions before they happen**, and gaps nobody owns.
4. **Carries decisions and rules between chats**, labelled as relays.
5. **Keeps the standing documents current**, and gets them carried to the working line.

**What it does not do: build product code, authorise work, arbitrate between two chats that can
settle it themselves, or hold any fact that lives nowhere else.**

---

## 3. The standing state report

**Every chat sends this to the orchestrator when any line changes — not on a schedule, which produces
either noise or silence.**

```
holding:     <worktree> at <SHA>, or "nothing"
building:    <one line>
blocked on:  <who or what>, or "nothing"
just landed: <SHA> <one line>
needs a decision: <one line>, or "nothing"
```

**Five lines. `just landed` is the one that stops duplicated work**, because a plan reads `git log` to
learn what has happened and `git log` shows intent and completion in the same shape.

---

## 4. Ensuring nothing is destroyed or overwritten

**These are the owner's words for what this role must prevent. Each maps to a measured failure.**

| Risk                 | The guard                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work overwritten** | Never a glob over shared paths — **a published carry rule with `docs/ward-flow-*.md` in it would have overwritten another chat's ledger; caught only by dry-running it.** Enumerate every path. |
| **Work destroyed**   | The protection hook, plus: no worktree removed, no branch deleted, no stash — **ever** — without the owner's explicit word.                                                                     |
| **Work duplicated**  | The four checks in the coordination rules, run **before** starting: ask the chats; grep for what the finished work would contain; `git show --stat`; check the brief against the filesystem.    |
| **Work overlooked**  | The `questions` rule — walk the **recorded** decisions, not the remembered ones. **A decision taken because nobody stopped you is a question you have not asked.**                              |
| **Work stranded**    | The carry, as part of every baton handover. **A document that cannot reach the line it governs is not a rule, it is a draft.**                                                                  |

---

## 5. What the orchestrator asks of the other four

1. **Keep refusing relays.** Especially now. **The role is new and its authority has not changed.**
2. **Correct this chat publicly and immediately.** Being corrected six times on 29–30 August is why
   the picture is now roughly right. **A quiet correction costs the other three chats.**
3. **Say what has already gone out before proposing who does what next** — a dispatch made is a fact,
   a plan to dispatch is a proposal, and they read identically in one paragraph.
4. **Never take a lock from a directory.** Say it, in a message, in both directions.

---

## An alarming result earns a broken-instrument check BEFORE it is sent

**Contributed by the design session, from a near-miss it caught on itself, and it belongs here rather
than in a ledger because it is about how a coordinator reports.**

Verifying that tonight's backup contained the decision register, its selector was
`ls "$B/bundles" | head -1` — **which selected `CONTENTS.txt`, not the bundle.** `git bundle
list-heads` on a text file fails silently, emits nothing, and the count came back **0**. The result
read: _"Ward-design refs in bundle: 0"_.

> **It was one message from telling the owner that his backup did not contain the register of
> record.**

**The fifth `head -1` failure of the day and by far the most expensive if it had been published** —
because the other four produced wrong facts, and **this one would have produced a false alarm about
lost work.** That is a different category: an alarming report is acted on immediately, and the action
is usually destructive. A hurried fold, a restore over good data, a cleanup reversed in a panic.

> **The rule: before sending a result that would alarm somebody, check whether your instrument is
> broken.** Not afterwards, when the alarm has already been acted on. **An ordinary wrong fact costs
> a correction; an alarming wrong fact costs whatever the reader did about it.**

**And the asymmetry decides how much checking is warranted**, which is the same test this charter
uses everywhere: _what does being wrong cost in each direction?_ Being slow with an alarm costs
minutes. Being wrong with one costs whatever was destroyed in response.

## Relaying a ruling goes wrong in BOTH directions, and I made both in one hour

**A ruling that widens a boundary gets read afterwards as widening the PRINCIPLE** — and the entries
most at risk are the ones that sound like a rounding error from what was permitted.

> **Nobody will propose _"let us store home addresses"_. Somebody will reason from _name, UMRN, date
> of birth_ that an address is one more field of the same kind** — and be wrong, because **a suburb
> identifies a service area and an address identifies a dwelling.** (`PD-3`, the design session.)

**I made the opposite error first, which is what makes the pair worth recording.** The owner
authorised name, UMRN, date of birth and age, with **fuzzy related-name matching as a stated
requirement**. I relayed **two of the four**, because two were all he had said _to me_ — and I
attached a warning not to read a permit-two as a permit-the-category.

**So within one hour the same relay was too narrow and then at risk of being too wide.**

| Direction      | How it happens                                         | What it costs                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Too narrow** | the ruling arrived in a thread the relayer was not in  | **a stated requirement silently dropped** — a UMRN-only build cannot match related names |
| **Too wide**   | the next reader infers the category from the instances | **an unruled field lands looking like compliance**                                       |

**And the asymmetry decides which to guard harder.** Too narrow **fails visibly**: somebody builds the
smaller thing and the owner sees it missing. **Too wide fails silently** — an address that nobody
argued for sits in a record and nothing objects.

> **So relay a ruling as an ENUMERATION with the unruled cases named**, never as a principle and
> never as a summary. _"`name`, UMRN, `dob`, age — and `address` and `history` are NOT ruled on"_ is
> the shape. **The named exclusions are the load-bearing half**, because they are what a later reader
> would otherwise infer their way past.

**The mechanical version beats every version of remembering it**, and the referrals session built it:
an allowlist whose entries **cannot authorise a stem that was never ruled on**, so a plausible
decision id beside `homeAddress` still fails. **Most allowlist designs treat presence in the list as
sufficient. This one makes the list unable to permit what nobody permitted.**

## A name in a coordinator's message is treated as verified, and mine reached another session's code

**I wrote `RECORD_ARRIVAL` in messages about the arrival event. The event is `PATIENT_ARRIVED`.**

**The untangle session took the name from my message, wrote it into three comments, and caught it
only when writing the test** — where `RECORD_ARRIVAL` appeared nowhere except its own prose.

**Verified after the fact:** `ward-flow-events.ts:80` declares `PATIENT_ARRIVED`, and
`RECORD_ARRIVAL` appears in **no document of mine at all.** So this was never a stale record. **I
invented it in conversation and it propagated**, which is worse than a stale document in one specific
way:

> **A document can be re-read and its claim checked against the tree. A message cannot — it arrives
> once, carrying the coordinator's apparent authority, and the receiving session has no reason to
> doubt a symbol name stated confidently.**

**And the position makes it worse rather than better.** A coordinator's messages are **input to other
sessions' code.** Everything I say about a symbol, a path or a field is read as though I looked —
**and tonight I twice did not**, this and the stale `referral-intake.tsx` path.

> **Rule: never write a symbol, path or field name in a message without having just read it.** Not
> "having read it once", not "remembering it" — **read it in the command whose output is in front of
> you.** If it has not been read, say so in the message: _"the arrival event, whatever it is called"_
> costs nothing and cannot propagate.

**This is the same defect as everything else tonight, one layer out:** a confident statement with no
signal attached, believed because nothing failed. **The difference is that the other instances cost a
wrong belief and this one cost another session's commit.**

## A refusal that only works when you guessed the direction right is a hunch with a rule around it

**The standing refusal was: _no session assumes `Fremantle` covers what Fiona Stanley would cover._**

**The owner's answer made the underlying inference wrong in the OPPOSITE direction from the one we
were guarding.** Fiona Stanley took most acute services from Fremantle, so **the natural assumption
was that Fremantle had stopped admitting.** Both admit. **Neither covers the other.** We were braced
for Fremantle being over-credited and the real risk was Fremantle being written off.

> **The refusal held anyway, and that is the entire argument for that kind of refusal.** It was never
> a bet on which way the fact went — **it was a refusal to bet at all.**

**The test, and it is checkable:** _would this refusal still have protected us if the fact had gone
the other way?_ **If no, it is not a refusal** — it is a hunch with a rule around it, and it will
fail silently the first time the guess is wrong.

**The same property distinguishes the good refusals from tonight.** _Do not derive home region from
the origin ED_ — holds whichever way the region turns out. _Do not infer the two unlabelled metro
blocks_ — holds whether or not the inference was correct. **None of them needed to know the answer,
which is why none of them could be wrong about it.**

**And it explains why "name the fact, not the direction of the mistake" is the better phrasing.** A
refusal aimed at one direction of a wrong inference **does not protect against the other**, and
whoever wrote it will not notice, because it was right about the thing it was worried about.

## When a refusal NAMES a holder, verify the holder — treat the citation as the claim

**`R43`, from the stale lock, and it generalises past locks.**

_"Another Database heavyweight command is active"_ was **true.** The holder was dead. **Re-reading the
message never helps, because the message is not wrong** — it is a correct statement answering a
question adjacent to the one being asked.

> **A blocker that cites an owner is checkable. Verify the owner is alive before believing the
> diagnosis** — the citation is the claim, not the refusal.

**Fourth instance of the family tonight**, beside the CR count that returned a line count, the
zero-byte output file, and the clean `git status` over a live mutation. **Each was true. Each invited
a wrong conclusion. None could be caught by looking harder at the message.**

## Written, verified and owned are three INDEPENDENT facts

**A status vocabulary that collapses them can only describe the combinations somebody happened to
think of** — and everything else gets silently reclassified into the nearest name that exists.

**The case: work written, verification owed, tree released deliberately.** Called _"in progress"_, a
reader waits for somebody who is not there. Called _"abandoned"_, a reader rebuilds work that is
finished. **Both false, both about an hour.**

> **A state nobody can name is a state somebody silently reclassifies.** Same shape as a provisional
> value with no word attached to it — **the missing label does not produce a gap, it produces a
> confident wrong reading.**

**And the session-level version is the same fix:** _"are you working?"_ offers two states where there
are three, so **waiting on a person** gets read as **stopped**. **_"What are you waiting for?"_ cannot
be answered wrongly by a session behaving correctly**, which is the property to design a status
question for.

## The FOURTH state: decided, implemented — and not present where it matters

**My charter has three states for a decision: DECIDED, IMPLEMENTED, BACKWARDS. There is a fourth and
it is the one I missed all night.**

**Measured 2026-08-30 at `7246806bb`:**

```
b2aefd1a0  the 23-file rename "released" -> "discharged"   NOT on the main line
main line   files using the literal "released"             16
main line   files using "discharged"                        0
board line  files using "released"                           0
```

**The owner renamed the third bed stage with a clinical reason** — _"released" reads as release from
detention._ **It was decided. It was implemented. It is not on the line anybody builds from**, so
every session working there writes the word he removed — **correctly, because it is the only
vocabulary the model on that line offers.**

> **A decision can be decided, implemented, and still absent where it matters.** Nothing about
> checking the decision, or checking the implementation, detects it. **You have to ask a third
> question: is it present on the line people build on?**

**And the cost COMPOUNDS rather than sitting still.** Every commit added in the old vocabulary is
another file the eventual merge must reconcile — **and it is a rename colliding with new code, the
exact class where a take-both resolution compiles, passes, and leaves two spellings.**

### Whose failure it was, and it was not the builder's

**The board session landed the rename and reported it landed. That was true.** What nobody did was
**check it had crossed.**

> **I re-measured branch state four times tonight and never once asked whether an owner's DECISION had
> reached the line people build on.** I was tracking **who holds what**, not **what they hold.**

**The custody question I built was _"which session is in which worktree"_. The missing one is _"is
every owner decision present on the working line?"_** — and that is checkable, mechanically, by
grepping the working line for the vocabulary a decision removed.

> **The remedy is a check rather than more vigilance: after any decision that renames or removes
> something, grep the WORKING line for what it removed. A non-zero count is the decision not having
> arrived.**

## A new ruling can VOID the reasoning of an already-closed question

**Caught by the design session on the handover ruling, and it is a gap in how I relay decisions.**

**`Q4` — _should the morning page and the shift-handover page be one page?_ — was closed with the
reasoning that `WB-DB-11` made the bed-state page live _"while the handover page stays deliberately
frozen."_** The contrast was the argument.

**Tonight's ruling removes the freeze. So the contrast is gone.**

> **The ANSWER may still be right — they are probably still two pages. Its stated REASON is void.**

**And a closed question carrying a dead reason is worse than an open one**, because a later reader
does one of two things with it: **reopens it needlessly**, or — far worse — **applies the reasoning
somewhere else on the strength of a justification that no longer holds.**

### The gap in my own practice, stated so it can be closed

**I relay a ruling by naming what it AUTHORISES and what it EXCLUDES.** Both look forward. **Neither
asks what the ruling INVALIDATES behind it.**

> **Third question for every ruling: which closed questions were closed BECAUSE of the fact this
> changes?** Then **mark them, do not reopen them** — the answer usually survives; only its
> justification has died.

**This is the same shape as the stale comment on the morning page**, one level up: **the behaviour
moved and the explanation did not.** There it was a code comment. Here it is a decision record — and
**a decision record is the artefact whose errors produce no signal at all.**

### And the rejected argument is worth keeping WITH its defect named

**The losing case for the handover freeze was sound:** everyone in the room reads the same numbers
while they talk. **It failed on one specific defect — the page does not say it is frozen.**

> **A rejected argument with its defect named is more useful than a rejected argument.** If freezing
> ever returns, it comes back as a deliberate choice **with a visible label**, rather than as
> something somebody argues for from scratch and re-loses the same way.

## THE CANARY: prove the check CAN fail before believing it passed

**This is the answer to the whole checks-that-cannot-fail family, and it is one extra step.**

**Before trusting a comparison, a grep, a count or a test that came back clean — break it on purpose
and confirm it goes red.** A word altered in the copy being compared. A canary line added to the file
being searched. An invented id where the check asserts ids resolve.

> **A check that has never been observed failing is not a check. It is a statement that happens to be
> green.**

**Every failure catalogued tonight would have been caught by it:**

| Failure                                                                            | The canary that would have caught it                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `head -1` selecting `CONTENTS.txt`, reporting the register missing from the backup | run it against a bundle known to contain the ref — it would still have said zero |
| A grep for a moved file returning zero, read as "the line is gone"                 | search for a string known to be in that file — also zero                         |
| A count of 67 read as work at risk                                                 | the discriminating flag returns 0, and the two disagree                          |
| An assertion of something already true, counted as coverage                        | **if you cannot construct a change that reddens it, it is not testing**          |
| A comparison certifying two ledgers identical                                      | a word inserted into one copy — must go red first                                |

**The cost is one command. The failures it prevents are the ones that produce CONFIDENT WRONG
ANSWERS**, which are the only kind nothing downstream catches.

### And a pattern finds candidates, not defects

**Fixing the malformed ledger row showed the other half.** Three rows matched a missing-pipe pattern;
**only one was the defect.** One ended with a pipe and a trailing space; another **deliberately
continued into a fenced code block, where adding a pipe would have damaged it.**

> **A blanket fix would have broken one row while repairing another.** The pattern produced
> candidates; **only reading each one produced the finding.** Automating the search is right;
> automating the fix is how a repair becomes a defect.

## PARTIAL RETIREMENT — worse than a duplicate, because nothing looks wrong from either side

**A decision was retired in the decisions register. The decision itself lives in a DIFFERENT
document, and recording the retirement in one place did not retire it in the other.**

> **A reader of that document finds a live decision the register believes is dead — and neither
> document looks wrong.**

**This is the two-registers failure in a shape neither of us had named.** A duplicate at least
disagrees with itself visibly. **A partial retirement is silent on both sides:** the register says
superseded, the source says nothing at all, and **only somebody holding both notices.**

> **Rule: state what you supersede IN THE DOCUMENT THAT CARRIES IT, in the same edit.** If you cannot
> reach that document, **say so and name who must** — a retirement you can only half-perform is a
> retirement that has not happened.

### And `R47` fired one message after it was written

**Searching for the superseded decision returned FIVE hits. Only TWO were it.** The other three read
_"stale capacity drops out of suggestions"_ — **a different rule about stale data, sharing a phrase.**

> **Marking all five would have retired a rule nobody retired**, in a diff that looked completely
> uniform. **Search wide, repair narrow, inspect every candidate before touching any** — recorded an
> hour earlier, needed immediately.

## ⚠️ THE SAME ID MEANS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IN TWO DOCUMENTS

**Ward Core searched for `Q4`, found one, and reported that my claim about it was false. It was
right about its document and wrong about the claim — because there are TWO `Q4`s.**

```
claude/Ward-design:docs/ward-flow-ledger.md:257
  Q4  "Should the morning page and the shift-handover page be one page?"

claude/ward-flow-phases-6-7-design:docs/ward-flow-phase-6-7-decisions.md:368
  Q4  "No missing stage. A released bed is allocatable immediately"
```

**Two registers, two independent numbering schemes, one namespace.** A session that searches the
document in front of it gets a **confident, complete, wrong answer** — no error, no ambiguity, a real
`Q4` that simply is not the one being discussed.

> **This is the two-registers failure in its purest form: not disagreement, but COLLISION.** And it
> is worse than disagreement, because two registers that disagree can be noticed. **Two registers
> that each answer confidently cannot.**

**Remedy: an id must carry its register.** `LEDGER-Q4` and `P67-Q4`, never bare `Q4`. **Anything
cited across documents needs a namespace or it will eventually resolve to the wrong thing** — and the
failure looks exactly like a correction.

## I gave the owner a REASON that was false, and the decision was right anyway

**I recommended the handover page stop freezing, and my stated reason was: _"a frozen page means
everyone reads the same numbers — that only holds if the page SAYS it is frozen, and it does not."_**

**It did. Verified in the pre-fix file:**

```
handover-page.tsx:69   <p className={styles.frozenAt} data-testid="ward-handover-frozen-at">
handover-page.tsx:70     Frozen at {formatInstant(snapshot.frozenAt)}
```

**Rendered, with its own test id, plus a governance banner saying it never updates while you read
it.** Fifteen occurrences of the word in that file. **I asserted its absence without looking.**

**The decision stands — and on a better reason that was already written down**, in
`ward-flow-decisions-2026-08-29.md`: paper already holds still, printing produces the stable artefact
honestly with a time on it, and _**"a frozen screen beside a live sheet is two numbers for one thing
in one room."**_

> **The failure is not the recommendation. It is that a decision would have been recorded with a
> false account of why the alternative lost** — on the one artefact where the reason is the entire
> point of writing it down. **A later reader re-arguing the freeze would have found a defect that
> never existed and concluded the record was unreliable.**

**And the lesson Ward Core drew is the transferable one: an instruction to record a losing argument
should be checked against the record first.** Twice tonight **the record was more complete than my
instruction about it.**

## The owner gave two opposite instructions in two threads within minutes — and the direct one wins

**To me: _"I want you to build the community hub also."_ To Ward Referrals, asked directly: _"I park
community hub."_** Minutes apart.

**Neither session was wrong and the relay was accurate.** I reported what he said to me. **He said
something else when asked in the thread that held the decision.**

> **This is not the relay failure I have been cataloguing all night. It is its mirror: the relay was
> faithful and the SOURCE differed by thread.**

**Ward Referrals had refused the relay and asked him directly. That refusal is what caught it** — and
it cost one sentence.

### The rule, and the asymmetry that makes it cheap

> **An UNPARK is the same class of instruction as an override: it reverses a decision made
> deliberately, so it comes from him or it does not come.**

**Confirming costs a sentence. Assuming costs a hub built for teams that do not exist** — discovered
at the point somebody tries to send a referral to one. **Entirely one-sided.**

### What this means for me specifically

**I have spent the night telling sessions that a ruling reaching one thread and not another is the
failure.** It is — **and this is the case where I was the thread that had it, and was still wrong.**

> **My relay being accurate is not the same as my relay being current.** A decision he restates when
> asked directly is the one that stands, **and a session declining my relay is not doubting me — it is
> checking the one thing I cannot check from here.**

**Do not treat a refused relay as friction to be reduced.** Twice tonight it caught something: once a
constraint I could not lift, and once an instruction that had already changed.

## 6. The measurement, at the moment of taking the role

**2026-08-30, measured rather than recalled.** This block is a **record of what was true then**, not a
fact about now — re-run the commands rather than trusting it.

```

  4ef1f7098   nine governance documents carried onto the working line
  e0bce1beb   the board line and the working line converged
```

**Open, and owned:** the morning page's three unbuilt decisions (needs the main line); the referral
front door R1/R3 (Current); the board rebuild (Future); `released` → `discharged`, 35 occurrences
across 16 files (Future, as one pass).

**Open, and owed to the owner:** nothing blocking. The presentation-versus-coding-category question
remains unanswered and is not blocking anything.

## ⚠️ I CANNOT ORDER THE OWNER'S INSTRUCTIONS ACROSS CHATS, AND TONIGHT THAT BIT

**The community hub.** He told Ward Referrals **"I park community hub."** He told me **"build all the
different individual screens, I.e transport, wards, ED, Coordinator, Community versions."** Ward
Referrals then asked him directly — _"build it, or keep it parked?"_ — **and he answered with
something else entirely.**

**Three exchanges, two sessions, and NOBODY CAN PUT THEM IN ORDER.** I do not know whether his
sentence to me came before or after his non-answer to them.

> **This is structural, not a lapse. Five parallel chats give the owner five inboxes and give me no
> clock.** Each session sees its own thread in order and every other thread not at all. **"The later
> instruction wins" is the right rule and it is unusable when later cannot be established.**

**What I did, and it is the rule:**

1. **Recorded BOTH halves** — the park and the reversal — rather than smoothing them into one line. A
   reader who finds only the park reads the build as somebody ignoring him.
2. **Put the disputed item LAST in the queue that owns it**, so time itself resolves it.
3. **Told the session not to take my word as his**, on an instruction that reverses one he gave them
   directly. **A reversal is authority, and authority does not relay.**
4. **Put it back to him as one line to confirm** — not as a blocking question, because nothing stops
   while it is open.

**The general form: when two owner instructions conflict and cannot be sequenced, do not adjudicate.
Preserve both, defer the item, and return the conflict to him as a single question.** Adjudicating
would have produced a defensible answer with no way to be wrong out loud.
