# Process Hardening Plan

> [!NOTE]
> **Historical Process Reference (PsychSift Monorepo):**
> This document records verification gates, CI design, and process hardening for the PsychSift monorepo (Supabase migrations, RAG evals, Docker builds, and Railway production).
> For current **Ward Flow** standalone repository rules and verification procedures, see [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and [`docs/ward-flow/HOW-WE-WORK.md`](ward-flow/HOW-WE-WORK.md).

This document turns the current process review into phased, durable repo practice. It separates changes that already take effect from work that should stay explicit until it is implemented.

## Cloud environment verification boundaries (2026-09-07)

The [Cloud reliability audit](audit/codex-cloud-reliability-20260907.md) records passing hosted
GitHub/runtime checks and the remaining external boundaries: the known raw `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
launcher injection and incomplete production privacy/governance evidence. Keep the raw guard
and release validator fail-closed. GitHub connectivity is not clinical production acceptance;
new lifecycle code still needs hosted branch evidence before its PR can claim that proof.

## Testing speed playbook (pointer)

Day-to-day selection, local Playwright keep-root, and refuted speed levers live in
[`docs/testing.md`](testing.md) § "Testing speed playbook". Measured CI shape and the
Production UI critical-path numbers remain in "CI shape and cost" below; do not raise
Playwright workers or revive the refuted cache/shard hacks listed there.

## Risk-routed local and CI verification (2026-08-02)

- `ci-change-scope.mjs` is the shared fail-closed classifier for local PR handoff and hosted CI. Only recognised documentation and workflow/policy paths take a light route; product code, tests, executable config, dependencies, database/container/RAG surfaces, mixed scope, and unknown non-document paths retain heavy verification.
- `verify:pr-local` no longer treats every handoff as lint + typecheck + full unit + RAG fixtures. It always checks runtime, installed-lock parity, and changed-file formatting, then selects documentation checks, focused workflow contracts, or the heavy executable plan. Its self-test makes those routing decisions a repository contract.
- `static-pr` remains required but step-routes the same signals. Workflow-only edits run focused workflow tests instead of full coverage and safety/RAG; documentation changes run documentation integrity checks; heavy/unknown changes retain lint, typecheck, coverage, safety/RAG, and all applicable build/UI/database/container jobs. `PR required` remains `if: always()` and requires every in-scope job, including `safety` whenever `static_heavy_changed` is true.
- Repeated low-yield provider work was removed from ordinary PRs: dependency audit runs when a lockfile/npm configuration can change the dependency tree (and on the scheduled full-run sentinel), eval-canary liveness moved to the daily Ops Digest cadence, and PR-body synchronization runs only when the current PR's own diff changes `PR_POLICY_BODY.md`.
- The operating rule is incremental value, not a fixed command count: each added check must cover a distinct plausible failure path. Never rerun an unchanged pass, and do not stack broad gates when one suitable gate already covers the risk.

## Gate receipts: never pay twice for the same local proof (2026-08-21)

"Never rerun an unchanged pass" was policy in `AGENTS.md` and in the bullet above, but nothing
enforced it, so it held only as well as a session remembered what it had already run. The costly
shape is ordinary: `verify:pr-local` runs `lint`, `typecheck` and the full Vitest suite, then
`verify:cheap` runs all three again on identical content, and GitHub then runs them a third time.
Only the third one is unavoidable.

`scripts/gate-receipts.mjs` removes the local repeats. Before an allowlisted gate runs, its wrapper
hashes the content that gate reads; if a receipt records the same gate exiting 0 on that exact
signature, the wrapper prints the reuse and exits 0 without re-running. Measured on this checkout:
~45 ms to sign 3.8k files, against gates that cost minutes.

- **Wired into** `run-heavy.mjs` (`lint`, `typecheck`, `typecheck:source`) and `run-vitest.mjs`
  (every non-coverage, non-watch, non-snapshot-update run, so `test` and `test:focused` included).
  `verify:pr-local` and `verify:cheap` inherit the behaviour because they shell out to those scripts.
- **Signature** = the git blob hash of every in-scope file, with working-tree modifications,
  untracked non-ignored files and deletions overlaid, plus a toolchain component (Node version,
  platform, and the `node_modules/.package-lock.json` install stamp). An unstaged edit invalidates
  the receipt; restoring the content revalidates it.
- **Scopes are whole-tree today, deliberately.** Both narrowing candidates read more than they look
  like they read: `tsconfig.typecheck.json` includes every root `.ts` file with `resolveJsonModule`,
  and the Vitest suite holds contract tests over `.github/workflows/`, `docs/` and `supabase/`.
  A narrower scope is a declared path list whose existence and non-emptiness the self-test asserts.
- **Store** is `node_modules/.cache/database-gate-receipts.json`: per-worktree, never committed,
  destroyed by `npm ci` — correct, because a reinstall changes the toolchain the receipt vouched for.

Boundaries, each of which is a test in `tests/gate-receipts.test.ts`:

- **CI never reuses a receipt.** `receiptsEnabled()` returns false whenever `CI` is set, and no
  receipt from any machine reaches CI. GitHub stays the authoritative merge gate.
- **Failures are never memoised**, and a tree that changed while the gate was running is not recorded.
- **Fail open.** Unreadable git state, or a scope resolving to zero files, runs the gate. A bug here
  costs a redundant run, never a skipped one.
- **Artefact-producing gates are excluded.** `build` and `test:coverage` leave `.next/` and
  `coverage/` behind, which downstream gates read; skipping them would serve stale output — the
  stale-`.next` trap `AGENTS.md` already documents under "Bundle budget".

Three false-skip holes were found by Codex review on PR #2216 and closed there, each now a
regression test. They are worth stating because they are the shape this mechanism fails in:

- **File modes are content.** `git update-index --chmod=+x` leaves the blob SHA untouched, so a
  signature over SHAs alone could not see a hook's executable bit being fixed — the exact bit
  `tests/session-start-hook.test.ts` guards. The signature now carries the index mode _and_ the
  working-tree mode: overwriting one with the other cancels the change being detected, which the
  first attempt at the fix did.
- **`--coverage` has more than one spelling.** Vitest accepts `--coverage.enabled` and
  `--coverage=true`; an exact-match exclusion list memoised those, after which a later run would
  skip and leave `coverage/` stale. Matching is by prefix now.
- **Some environment variables change the verdict.** `FAST_CHECK_SEED` is read by
  `tests/property-seed.ts` at import time and exists precisely so a developer can reproduce a
  property failure; without it in the key, `FAST_CHECK_SEED=123 npm run test` served the default
  seed's pass. `OUTCOME_AFFECTING_ENV_VARS` declares the set; performance-only knobs stay out.

Reporting: a reused receipt proves the gate passed on this content, not that it ran just now. Say
"reused receipt from <time>", never "I ran it". `GATE_RECEIPTS=refresh` forces a real run when fresh
evidence is what is wanted; `GATE_RECEIPTS=off` disables the mechanism; `npm run receipts` shows the
current signature and stored receipts; `npm run receipts:clear` empties the store.

**What this does not do.** It does not reduce GitHub's work, and it should not: CI must re-verify
what it is scoped to verify, and `ci-change-scope.mjs` already keeps that scoped. The local run is
not waste either — it is what stops a red push costing a full CI cycle plus a fix round. The waste
was only ever the _repeat_, and that is what is now gone.

## Gate arbitration: stop paying for a verdict GitHub is about to reach (2026-08-21)

The receipts section above closes by saying the local run "is not waste either — it is what stops a
red push costing a full CI cycle". True, and incomplete. `check:gate-manifest` enforces that CI never
runs less of the local `verify:cheap` static set than the local chain does, which read the other way
says **every local run of a gate in that chain is work GitHub is about to repeat**. Receipts cannot
touch that duplication by design: `receiptsEnabled()` is false whenever `CI` is set.

So the local run is a bet, not a certainty. It pays when it fails (a red push costs a CI cycle plus a
fix round, and ~40% of PR CI runs measured 2026-07-30 were cancellations); it pays nothing when it
passes. The bet's value is therefore not fixed — it decays as a gate stops catching things on a given
class of change, and it recovers the moment the gate catches something again. Nothing measured that,
so the decision was made from habit in both directions: running the full suite on a docs typo, and
skipping it on a change that deserved it.

`scripts/gate-arbiter.mjs` measures it. Three inputs, none hard-coded:

- **CI coverage**, parsed live from `package.json` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` using the same
  field-anchored `run:` regex as `check-gate-manifest.mjs` (the two must agree — a looser parse here
  would defer to a job the manifest check knows does not exist). Resolved by the gate's own name, its
  declared CI equivalent (`test` → `test:coverage`), or a CI-invoked aggregate whose package.json body
  contains it — and then **evaluated against the current change scope**. A step's presence in the YAML
  is not coverage: `lint` and `typecheck` carry a step-level `if: needs.changes.outputs.static_heavy_changed`,
  and the `coverage` job is gated on `coverage_changed`, so a docs-only change is covered by none of
  the three. A name-only scan reported all three covered, which under `GATE_ARBITER=enforce` produced
  the one outcome the module exists to prevent — local gate deferred, CI gate skipped, no verdict
  anywhere. Raised as P1 by Codex review on PR #2245 and pinned by `tests/gate-arbiter.test.ts`.
  Conditions that are not change-scope flags (draft state, event name) cannot be evaluated from a
  worktree; they are reported as assumed preconditions with the decision rather than silently taken as
  true. **A gate CI does not re-run for this change is never deferrable.**
- **Observed yield**, a rolling window (40 observations) keyed by `(gate, change class)`, recorded by
  `run-heavy.mjs` and `run-vitest.mjs` after every arbitrated run. Recording is pure observation and
  never alters the run. An admission-busy exit (75) is not a verdict and is not recorded, so lock
  contention can neither manufacture a clean window nor keep a healthy gate running forever.
- **Content identity**, via `record-ci <sha>`: a clean worktree plus an empty `git diff <sha> HEAD`
  proves the content GitHub judged is the content in front of us. Both halves are required — a clean
  tree alone does not prove HEAD has not moved, and a matching diff alone cannot see an uncommitted
  edit. Reading GitHub is provider-backed, so the arbiter never reaches for it; the session that
  already looked at CI passes what it saw.

Change class comes from `scripts/ci-change-scope.mjs` — the classifier CI itself uses to route jobs —
rather than a second risk model, so the arbiter and CI cannot drift into two opinions about what a
path means. Clean-window sizes: `docs` 3, `source` 12. Every other class (`db`, `rag`, `deps`,
`container`, `workflow`, `ui`, `unknown`) is absent from the window map and never defers at any length.
`tests/gate-arbiter.test.ts` pins that absence, so adding a risky class to the deferrable set fails.

Boundaries, each of them a test in `tests/gate-arbiter.test.ts`:

- **Fail open.** Unreadable CI, unknown class, missing observations, git failure — all run the gate.
- **CI never consults it.** `arbiterMode()` returns disabled whenever `CI` is set.
- **Advisory by default.** The wrappers act on a deferral only under `GATE_ARBITER=enforce`; a gate a
  human typed still runs. `GATE_ARBITER=off` disables it entirely.
- **The first catch re-arms the window**, so a gate that starts failing again is never left deferred
  because it had a long clean run beforehand.
- **A narrowed Vitest run records under its own identity** (`vitest(selected)`), so a clean history of
  focused runs can never satisfy the full suite's window.
- **`record-ci` requires an explicit gate list**, and rejects a SHA that does not resolve here, so one
  observed green job cannot become stored proof for every arbitrated gate.
- **Observations are re-read immediately before the write**, so two gates finishing together cannot
  drop a catch — the unsafe direction, since a lost catch leaves a failing gate deferred.
- **A deferred gate is not a passed gate.** The verdict prints that sentence; report it as "deferred
  to CI", never as green.

`npm run arbiter -- <gate>` gives the verdict and its evidence; `npm run arbiter:status` shows the
yield ledger and the accumulated duplication bill; `npm run arbiter:clear` empties it. The ledger sits
beside the receipt store under `node_modules/.cache/`, so it is per-worktree, never committed, and
destroyed by `npm ci`.

**What this does not do.** It does not reduce GitHub's work, weaken any required check, or change
which gate is the smallest correct one for a diff. It decides only whether that gate still has
anything left to tell you before you push.

## Multi-worktree reconciliation hardening (2026-07-23)

The cloud-chat reconciliation postmortem and complete issue/fix matrix are in
[`docs/archive/cloud-chat-reconciliation-postmortem-2026-07-23.md`](archive/cloud-chat-reconciliation-postmortem-2026-07-23.md).
The reusable procedure is [`docs/reconciliation-playbook.md`](reconciliation-playbook.md).

- `node scripts/reconciliation-preflight.mjs` is an explicit, report-only inventory for broad reconciliation and
  cleanup. It uses cached Git refs, never fetches, and reports primary/worktree dirty state,
  detached worktrees, ahead/behind counts, and operation markers. Add `--include-processes` only
  when ownership could block cleanup; that path emits metadata/counts and never raw command lines.
- `node scripts/reconciliation-evidence-pack.mjs --output <path>` writes one deterministic secret-safe
  local evidence pack (atomic) covering dispositions, markers, archive refs, bundle verification,
  hashes, worktree counts, and local/base tree equality without fetching or deleting.
- `node scripts/primary-checkout-lease.mjs --check` is the cooperative primary-write gate: refuse a
  second primary writer while another live owner or dirty/operation state exists; keep read-only
  work and independent feature worktrees unblocked.
- `workflow:lifecycle -- --phase reconcile` selects the preflight and evidence pack locally and lists remote fetch as
  a separate approval-required action. `start`/`cleanup` select the primary-checkout lease check.
- Candidate filtering is cheap-first: owner/open-PR/review-ledger/ancestry before patch comparison;
  `merge-tree` remains a last resort. This avoids repeating the slow all-ref sweep that dominated the
  historical reconciliation.
- Heavy verification uses resource-aware admission: two focused Vitest/read-only typecheck leases may overlap across different worktrees, while full suites, coverage, lint, builds, and browser runs remain exclusive. Inspect coordinator/process/artifact state before retrying, never rerun an unchanged pass, and record interrupted aggregate suites as incomplete.
- `scripts/test-run-lock.mjs` redacts credential-bearing command text before it reaches coordinator metadata
  or a contention error. `scripts/run-eval-safe.mjs` uses command lines only inside its workspace
  filter and serializes PID/parent/start metadata only.

## Repository cleanup follow-ups (2026-07-19)

- **ModeHomeMain vertical alignment (fixed in #938):** commit `39d14a51` made standalone mode homes a `flex-1 justify-center` shell. That centres short empty homes correctly, but when differentials (and any tall results view) reused the same wrapper, the top of the content was clipped above the phone scrollport — white gap under the header, Best Answer unreachable, first visible list card looking like rank “2”. Prefer `ModeHomeMain`’s `contentAlign` prop (`center` | `start` | `startOnPhone`); never pass `justify-*` via `className` (`cn()` does not merge Tailwind). Guards: `tests/mode-home-main-align.test.ts` plus the narrow-viewport Best Answer fold assertion in `tests/ui-tools.spec.ts`.
- **Local process ownership (resolved):** `scripts/run-eval-safe.mjs` now terminates only the spawned
  child and its descendant tree through `terminateOwnedProcessTree(child.pid)`; focused tests prove
  unrelated Vitest, Playwright, and Next processes are not targeted. Repository discovery remains
  Node-filtered. Process command lines are no longer serialized out of the Windows inventory.
- **Provider-gated RAG safety ideas (closed obsolete — outstanding-issues #004):** the same stale worktree contained conservative answer-quality thresholds, an evaluation cost-cap preflight, production-safety validation, deep-health assessment, and citation/vector proof tests. Its 754-line retrieval migration and route changes conflicted with the later public-title privacy and migration chain and must not be replayed. This item is now resolved: the rescue source is unrecoverable (pruned across all reachable refs), the answer-quality thresholds and deep-health assessment already shipped on current `main` (#585/#587), and the only genuinely-missing piece — the evaluation cost-cap preflight — was dropped rather than re-filed. No rescope action remains.
- **Semantic reranking rollout debt:** PR #901 keeps `RAG_SEMANTIC_RERANK_ENABLED=false`. Do not enable it until the provider-backed 36/36 retrieval-quality gate and an ambiguity-focused canary are explicitly approved and recorded.

## Staging tenancy evidence

The provider-backed A/B tenancy regression is intentionally outside local and PR
gates. Run the standalone manual/nightly workflow and attach a recent green evidence
artifact before release; see
[`docs/staging-tenancy-release-evidence.md`](staging-tenancy-release-evidence.md).

## Open PR branch sync (operator-only)

- **Problem:** landing one PR advances `main` and leaves the rest of a large open
  queue behind. GitHub then marks many heads `CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY` even when the
  merge tree is clean, which stalls squash auto-merge and creates endless manual
  re-sync churn.
- **Mitigation:** automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN` branch mutation was retired after repeated
  `github-actions[bot]` heads left CI, SAST, and secret-scan runs awaiting approval. Use the local
  helper deliberately: `npm run sync:pr-branches` is report-only and
  `npm run sync:pr-branches:apply` verifies and uses the current human/operator `gh` identity,
  refusing missing or bot identities. Opt out with
  `hold`, `do-not-merge`, or `skip-branch-sync`.
- **Guardrail:** `npm run check:github-actions` rejects workflow-authored GitHub
  `update-branch` calls. Do not weaken required checks or widen approval for untrusted actors to
  remove queue friction; change this policy only with a separately reviewed authentication model.
- **Operator rule:** prefer clearing the open queue (merge or close) over keeping
  dozens of long-lived feature branches that all touch the same shared docs.

## PR bundling reduces per-task CI churn (2026-07-30)

- **Problem, measured:** PR #1406 sampled the last 500 CI workflow runs (~3 days of PR
  traffic, 437 PR-triggered): 213 succeeded, 45 failed, 176 (~40%) cancelled — mostly
  superseded by a newer push before Production UI finished, burning roughly 12
  Production-UI-hours on runs that never completed. Every task minting its own
  `claude/<task-slug>` branch and PR means a single trivial one-line change pays the
  same required-CI bill as a large change.
- **Rule:** see AGENTS.md "PR bundling (reduce one-task-one-PR churn)" — bundle
  same-scope, independently low-risk, separately-revertible-commit work into one PR
  instead of minting a branch per task.
- **Does not change:** required-check scoping, per-commit verification rigor, or the
  deliberate "1 PR per work order" convention for tracked staged rollouts (maturity
  backlog, `#086`) or anything crossing a clinical-risk/RAG-ranking-surface path.
- **Clinical vs. operational risk bundling detection (#178):** While low-risk same-scope tasks should bundle to reduce CI churn, bundling operational-risk changes with clinical or UI changes is an anti-pattern. `scripts/pr-policy.mjs` detects when `operationalRisk` paths (`.github/workflows/`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, root tool configs, `Dockerfile`, `railway.json`, `nixpacks.toml`) are bundled with `clinicalRisk` (`supabase/`, `src/app/api/`, clinical/RAG/auth libs, clinical reference datasets) or `ui` surfaces (`src/app/`, `src/components/`, `public/`, UI specs). The PR policy emits an advisory warning (`Operational-risk changes are bundled with <classes> changes. Split the PR where practical so each risk class remains independently revertible.`) to keep operational infra and patient-safety or visual regressions independently revertible.

## Anti-conflict and silent-CI signal (2026-07-30)

- **Operating procedure:** AGENTS.md "Anti-conflict and CI-speed operating procedure".
  Future-process only — do not mutate unrelated active PRs unless explicitly asked.
- **Outstanding-issues concurrency (`#112`):** the structural gate landed in PR #1410
  (`check:outstanding-issues`, wired into `verify:cheap` / CI `static-pr` — duplicate IDs,
  both-tables, stale `issues:next-id`, malformed rows; retired with the rest of the
  outstanding-issues ledger on the Ward Flow line, 26 September 2026). PR #1416 added `merge=union` in
  `.gitattributes`; it is now **removed** and the runtime attribute check inverted to require
  no driver at all. Union could not allocate unique IDs either, and it concatenated
  conflicting hunks instead of failing — two marker bumps became two `next-id` lines (`#133`),
  and on 2026-07-30 it duplicated the whole open-items table on four merges (PR #1430).
  Default 3-way merge conflicts loudly instead; the structural gate remains required.
- **Silent CI on conflicted PRs (`#116`):** when GitHub cannot build
  `refs/pull/<n>/merge`, every `pull_request` workflow is skipped with no failing check.
  `.github/workflows/pr-mergeability.yml` checks trusted `pull_request_target` events and
  uses a protected-base `push` sweep to publish a fresh `PR mergeability` check on each
  unchanged open-PR head. Only that sweep receives job-scoped `checks: write`; neither path
  checks out PR code or updates branches. Behind-but-clean heads remain an operator
  `sync:pr-branches` concern. Contract: `npm run check:pr-mergeability`.
- **Confirmed in the field the same day (PR #1427):** that PR pushed, opened, and was marked
  ready for review while producing **zero** `pull_request` runs — no `CI`, no `Gitleaks`, no
  `Semgrep` — with only `pull_request_target` (`PR policy`) firing. `git merge-tree` showed
  real conflicts against a base 35 commits ahead. The new `PR mergeability` check caught it
  and named the cause. Read a missing check list as a conflict signal, never as a pass.

## CI shape and cost, measured per job (2026-07-30)

The PR #1406 sample above counts runs. This is where the time inside one goes — job-level
timings from two full UI-scope PR runs (`30520443076`, `30519912667`), read from the Actions
API rather than estimated:

| Job               | Duration        | On the critical path?    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Change scope      | 13 s            | yes                      |
| Static PR checks  | 3m03            | no                       |
| Safety and config | 47 s            | no                       |
| Unit coverage     | 3m57            | no                       |
| Advisory UI       | 3m14            | no                       |
| **Production UI** | **15m26–16m31** | **yes — 83–89% of wall** |
| PR required       | 5 s             | yes                      |
| **Whole run**     | **16.8–18.6 m** |                          |

- **Every other job finishes by minute 4 and then waits ~12 minutes for Production UI.**
  Inside it, Playwright reported `339 passed (13.5m)`; the remaining ~2 min is the isolated
  production build. Docs-only PRs run 3–5.5 min.
- Because the 42% cancellation rate is dominated by pushes that supersede a run mid-Production-UI,
  almost all of the wasted runner time is this one job. Shortening it cuts churn cost directly.
- **`ui-critical` is therefore sharded across runners** (`ci.yml`), not parallelised within one:
  `workers: 1` / `fullyParallel: false` / `retries: 0` are unchanged inside each shard, so
  determinism is identical and per-runner load falls — which matters because `#093`'s duplicate
  page root is load-dependent.
- **The shard count is measured, not chosen.** With `fullyParallel: false` a spec file is
  indivisible, so shard sizes are lumpy. Against the 342 required chromium tests on the
  post-merge tree, N=3 gives 121/111/110 and N=4 gives 121/106/98/17 — the same 121-test
  bound for an extra runner. On the 340-test tree just before, N=5 and N=8 produced **empty**
  shards, which would go red because `test:e2e:pr` deliberately omits `--pass-with-no-tests`.
  Re-measure with
  `npx playwright test --project=chromium --grep-invert "@quarantine|@mockup" --shard=i/N --list`
  (needs a running server via `npm run ensure` and `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`) before changing N,
  and keep every shard non-empty.
- **These timings predate `ui-critical-fast`.** The `@critical` fail-fast job (15 tests) now
  runs before the full suite, so the UI critical path is that job plus the slowest shard.
- **Measured on the first real sharded run** (CI `30530618838`, 2026-07-30, all green):
  `ui-critical-fast` 3m14, then shards of 9m36 / 6m54 / 6m20; whole run **13m39** against a
  16.8–18.6 min unsharded baseline. **The prediction from test counts was wrong by ~40%:**
  6.8 min was expected for the largest shard, 9m36 happened. Per-test cost is not uniform —
  111 tests took 6m54 while 121 took 9m36 — so a count-balanced split understates the slowest
  shard whenever the slow specs land together. `--shard` can only balance by count; balancing
  by duration would require splitting the slow spec files themselves. Prefer a measured run
  over the arithmetic when judging any further shard change.
- **Which spec drags shard 1, measured 2026-07-30** by running `--shard=1/3` locally and
  summing per-test durations from the list reporter (121 passed, 6.9 min):

  | Spec                               | Time   | Tests | Per test  |
  | ---------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | --------- |
  | `ui-phone-scroll.spec.ts`          | 267.0s | 56    | **4.77s** |
  | `ui-chrome-scroll.spec.ts`         | 56.3s  | 17    | 3.31s     |
  | `ui-accessibility.spec.ts`         | 28.1s  | 15    | 1.87s     |
  | `ui-formulation.spec.ts`           | 18.2s  | 7     | 2.60s     |
  | `ui-overlap.spec.ts`               | 15.3s  | 14    | 1.09s     |
  | `answer-progress-ui-smoke.spec.ts` | 12.2s  | 2     | 6.10s     |
  | `ui-mode-nav-density.spec.ts`      | 6.8s   | 7     | 0.97s     |
  | `ui-hydration.spec.ts`             | 5.2s   | 3     | 1.73s     |

  **`ui-phone-scroll.spec.ts` is 65% of the shard** — 267s of 409s — at the worst per-test rate
  of any large spec in it. It is also the file behind both `#127` and `#146`. Re-measure with
  `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium node scripts/run-playwright.mjs --project=chromium --grep-invert "@quarantine|@mockup" --shard=1/3`
  before acting — local absolute times differ from CI, but the per-spec ranking holds.

- **"Splitting the slow spec rebalances the shards" is REFUTED, measured 2026-07-30.** That
  claim appeared in this document and in PR #1453; it is wrong, and the correction matters more
  than the original guess. `ui-phone-scroll.spec.ts` was split into three files (21 / 19 / 16
  tests) and the shard distribution did not move at all:

  |               | Before                | After                 |
  | ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
  | Project total | 342 tests, 18 files   | 342 tests, 20 files   |
  | Shard 1       | 121 (56 phone-scroll) | 121 (56 phone-scroll) |
  | Shard 2       | 111 (0)               | 111 (0)               |
  | Shard 3       | 110 (0)               | 110 (0)               |

  **Why:** `--shard` does not distribute files, it walks them in collection order (alphabetical)
  and cuts at test-count boundaries. Sibling files named `ui-phone-scroll*` sort adjacently, so
  all three land in the same shard. The shards were already count-balanced; the imbalance is
  duration, and splitting a file cannot fix a metric the scheduler does not use:

  ```text
  shard 1  121 tests / 10 files — phone-scroll(56), chrome-scroll(17), accessibility(15), overlap(14), …
  shard 2  111 tests /  4 files — ui-smoke(92), route-coverage(12), specifiers(5), pwa(2)
  shard 3  110 tests /  6 files — ui-tools(87), universal-search(16), stress(3), …
  ```

  Shard 1 is slow because it holds ten _slow-per-test_ files while shards 2 and 3 are dominated
  by one fast-per-test file each. **Shipped:** explicit duration-aware file groups in
  `scripts/playwright-pr-shards.mjs` (CI `test:e2e:pr:shard -- --shard N`) with
  `tests/playwright-pr-shards.test.ts` asserting every production e2e:pr spec is in exactly one
  non-empty group. Re-measure wall time after suite growth before reshuffling membership.

- **PR #1686 final hosted measurement corrected its first explicit split** (CI `31285952061`,
  2026-08-09): the three production steps ran **146 passed (5.5m)**, **122 passed (3.7m)**, and
  **135 passed (2.4m)**, so the 9m08 / 6m17 / 5m07 jobs were still duration-imbalanced. The dated
  per-file profile now predicts full groups of about **239s / 223s / 219s** and post-critical PR
  groups of about **218s / 223s / 216s**. The profile is the membership source of truth; its test
  fails when either mode drifts beyond 30 seconds.
- The same run proved two structural wastes. The later shards repeated all 15 `@critical` tests
  (10 in `ui-smoke`, 5 in `ui-tools`), so PR/merge-queue groups now exclude them; events where the
  fast job skips retain the full set. The critical job also uploaded a **1,092,887,876-byte**
  webpack artifact and shards spent 19–67 seconds downloading it. Their warm builds still took
  roughly 72–82 seconds versus about 107 seconds cold; the slowest path lost ~43 seconds. The
  cross-job artifact is removed. Do not restore it without a same-run net wall-time win.

  **Stop:** do not "fix" this by renaming spec files so they sort into different shards. It
  works, and it encodes undocumented scheduler behaviour into filenames where the next reader
  cannot see it.

## Phase 1 - Active now

- `npm run verify:cheap` is the broad offline local gate for cross-module risk: 38 static/consistency gates (`check:runtime` through `check:owner-scope`; `npm run check:gate-manifest` lists them and pins the count), then lint, typecheck, and unit tests. It is selected, not automatic for every source/config/test edit.
- `npm run verify:pr-local` is the risk-routed local mirror of the normal PR gate: runtime, installed-lock parity, changed-file format, conditional `npm ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts` for package/lockfile edits, then focused docs/workflow contracts or the fail-closed executable plan with lint, typecheck, one full unit run, conditional build, and RAG fixture/manifest validation. Local scope resolves against the repository default base rather than a feature-branch upstream; set `PR_BASE_REF` explicitly for release-targeted PRs.
- `npm run verify:ui` is the complete required production Chromium gate: `check:runtime` plus all non-quarantined production journeys (`test:e2e:pr`).
- `npm run verify:release` is the release-confidence gate: `check:runtime`, lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, full Playwright browser matrix, `check:production-readiness`, `governance:release`, and `eval:quality:release` (the last step needs live Supabase and OpenAI keys).
- CI uses a risk-scoped PR gate: `changes` classifies paths, `static-pr` always runs runtime/install parity, scope/plan self-tests, diff integrity, and changed-file formatting, and `pr-required` is the single always-reporting required aggregate. Focused documentation or workflow contracts run for recognised light scopes; mixed heavy+workflow changes do not repeat the same workflow suites outside full coverage. Lint/typecheck, one full unit run with coverage, safety/RAG, build, both Docker image builds, required production Chromium, and migration replay run only when their file scopes apply; unknown non-document paths fail closed to this heavy route. UI PRs also run one non-blocking advisory Chromium invocation for quarantined and mockup journeys. The external `Supabase Preview` check may still replay migrations on branch databases when enabled. `release-browser-matrix` runs on UI/performance/lockfile-relevant `main` pushes and every release/manual/scheduled run; the wrapper owns its build and omits production Chromium only after that project passed earlier in the same run. Lighthouse baseline refresh is a focused dispatch exception, not a full-run sentinel.
- `tests/ui-accessibility.spec.ts` covers reduced-motion and forced-colors dashboard usability so those modes are no longer only reviewed by inspection.
- `tests/ui-tools.spec.ts` covers the Applications dashboard mode at mobile and desktop sizes, including the `/applications` compatibility redirect.
- `AGENTS.md` now points future agents to these gates and to this document.

## Phase 2 - Active now

- Previous deterministic smoke failures are reclassified as resolved in the current Chromium UI gate: `npm run verify:ui` passed 26/26 on June 23, 2026.
- Local scratch and visual-capture output are excluded from Prettier through `.prettierignore` so generated investigation files do not block the format gate.
- Pull requests now include a clinical governance preflight for ingestion, answer generation, source rendering, privacy, production environment, and clinical-output changes.
- Applications mode now has dedicated Playwright coverage in the UI gate.
- `tests/ui-stress.spec.ts` uses a **1000px** desktop viewport (below `lg`) because scope and evidence open in sheets, not side panels, at that width; widening to ≥1024 exercises a different UI path.

## Phase 3 - Structural cleanup

- [x] Decompose `src/components/ClinicalDashboard.tsx` into the planned `src/components/clinical-dashboard/` modules. **DONE** — all 6 approved render-surface modules extracted (~8.8k → ~4.7k lines); see the progress log below. Only the deferred admin surfaces remain in the monolith.
- Preserved `data-testid`, `aria-label`, and AST-pinned `ClinicalOutputPanel`/`NaturalLanguageAnswer` contracts across every move (byte-identical sha1 checksum + retargeted AST guards).
- After decomposition, run `npm run verify:cheap`, `npm run verify:ui`, and focused visual/browser checks against the dashboard and document viewer.

### Phase 3 progress (started)

- Added `src/components/clinical-dashboard/` as the module boundary.
- `src/app/page.tsx` now imports `ClinicalDashboard` from the module path (`@/components/clinical-dashboard`) while preserving
  the legacy source declaration file for AST and merge-guard compatibility.
- **2026-07-03:** extracted `AuthPanel` (+ its solely-consumed auth-email snapshot helpers) into `clinical-dashboard/auth-panel.tsx`. Monolith 7924 → 7800 lines. Per-module gate established: `npm run typecheck` + `npx vitest run tests/clinical-dashboard-merge-artifacts.test.ts tests/rendered-text-formatting.test.ts` + a `data-testid`/`aria-label` sha1 checksum over `ClinicalDashboard.tsx` + `clinical-dashboard/*.tsx` (must be byte-identical before/after each move) + lint + prettier.
- **2026-07-03:** extracted `answer-content.tsx` — `SourceImage`, `ScopeAndGovernanceNotice`, the answer/source formatters, `SourcePreviewContent`, `NaturalLanguageAnswer`, `UserQuestionBubble`, `KeyClinicalItems` (block 510–1249 against the post-drift monolith), moved verbatim (block diff empty; testid/aria checksum byte-identical). Two shared helpers went to clean homes instead of a monolith↔module cycle: `useMobilePreviewSheet` (+ its media-query snapshot helpers) → new `clinical-dashboard/use-mobile-preview-sheet.ts`, and `comparableAnswerText` → `clinical-dashboard/display-text.ts`. Retargeted the `NaturalLanguageAnswer` AST pin to scan `answer-content.tsx`, and widened `rendered-text-formatting.test.ts` negative scans to the monolith+module corpus (both strengthened, not weakened). Reusable finding: the answer/evidence families' helpers already live in `@/lib/*` and extracted sibling modules, so extractions re-import rather than needing wide monolith exports; only `comparableAnswerText`/`useMobilePreviewSheet` were monolith-internal.
- **2026-07-03:** extracted `evidence-panels.tsx` — the clinical-detail/notes helper family + `AnswerSupportSummaryCard`, `ClinicalNotesChecklistPanel`, `SafetyFindingsPanel`, `EvidenceGapPanel`, `EvidenceCounts`, `AnswerSourceStatus`, `EvidenceSummaryCard`, `AnswerInsightBar`, `EvidenceVerificationStrip`, `AnswerFeedbackPanel`, `RenderModelSourceList`, `VerificationWorkspace`, `AnswerViewModeControl`, `EvidenceMapTable`, `AnswerSafetyNotice`, `QuoteCards` (contiguous block 484–2311, moved verbatim). Monolith 7909 → 6084 lines. **This module needs a monolith↔module cycle** — `ClinicalNotesChecklistPanel` renders `<ClinicalOutputPanel/>` (staying in the monolith as B3), so evidence-panels imports `ClinicalOutputPanel` + `clinicalQueryModeOptions` + `type AnswerFeedbackType` back from `@/components/ClinicalDashboard`. This is the SAME pattern already used by `global-mockup-search-shell.tsx` (imports `SettingsDialog` back); the repo has no `import/no-cycle` rule and the refs are render/runtime-time so init is safe (the `ui-smoke` build is the definitive cycle check). The monolith imports 26 symbols back (incl. the exported detail-helper family for output-panel). Robust dependency finding: the danger/reverse regex missed `const X: Type =` and `const X = {…}` forms (caught `clinicalQueryModeOptions` + `simpleClinicalTableProps` only via typecheck) — use a name-only regex `^(export )?(async )?(function|const|type) NAME` next time.

- **2026-07-03:** extracted `output-panel.tsx` — `ClinicalOutputPanel` (block 487–688, moved verbatim). Monolith 6084 → 5882 lines. Clean move: empty danger set (no monolith-internal deps) and empty reverse set (the monolith never rendered it — its only consumer is `evidence-panels`'s `ClinicalNotesChecklistPanel`). This **replaced** the evidence-panels↔monolith cycle with an evidence-panels↔output-panel one: `evidence-panels` now imports `ClinicalOutputPanel` from `clinical-dashboard/output-panel` (still imports `clinicalQueryModeOptions` + `type AnswerFeedbackType` from the monolith); `output-panel` imports the detail-helper family + `AnswerViewModeControl`/`EvidenceMapTable` from `evidence-panels`. Retargeted the AST pin (`ClinicalOutputPanel` now resolves via the `scannedFiles` array's `output-panel.tsx` entry) and added `output-panel.tsx` to the `rendered-text-formatting.test.ts` corpus. Stripped 8 now-orphaned monolith imports.

- **2026-07-03:** extracted `visual-evidence.tsx` — `compactClinicalTableCaption`, `visualEvidenceHeader`, `VisualEvidenceStrip`, `InlineTableCard`, `supportDotClass`, `supportLabel`, `claimRowsForEvidencePanel`, `EvidenceClaimsList`, `EvidenceGapsPanel`, `MobileEvidenceSheetContent`, `MobileEvidenceTabPanel`, `UnifiedEvidenceDrawerContent` (contiguous block 547–1259, moved verbatim). Monolith 5953 → 5241 lines. **No runtime cycle** — the only monolith import is `type AnswerFeedbackType` (erased at compile time); the module imports one-way from `evidence-panels`/`answer-content`/siblings, and the monolith imports `InlineTableCard` + `MobileEvidenceSheetContent` back. Added `visual-evidence.tsx` to the `rendered-text-formatting.test.ts` corpus (the `item.tableTextSnippet`/`item.title`/`item.caption` render surfaces moved here). Stripped 22 now-orphaned monolith imports. Done on a **dedicated worktree/branch** `claude/clinical-dashboard-decomp` (off `main`) instead of the shared claude branch, to avoid the squash-ancestry churn.

- **2026-07-03:** extracted `document-results.tsx` — `WhyThisMatchedPanel`, `RelatedDocumentsPanel`, `StagedAnswerResultSurface` (contiguous block 456–944, moved verbatim). Monolith 5216 → 4726 lines. **No runtime cycle** — the only monolith import is `type AnswerFeedbackType` (erased); `StagedAnswerResultSurface` is a leaf result-surface that imports one-way from every sibling module (answer-content, evidence-panels, visual-evidence, relevance, document-search-results, badges, dashboard-shell, display-text, use-mobile-preview-sheet) and the monolith imports `RelatedDocumentsPanel` + `StagedAnswerResultSurface` back. The monolith's `visual-evidence` import (`InlineTableCard`/`MobileEvidenceSheetContent`) moved into `document-results` as predicted. Added `document-results.tsx` to the `rendered-text-formatting.test.ts` corpus; stripped 35 now-orphaned monolith imports.

- **2026-07-04:** answer-review hygiene — `StagedAnswerResultSurface` now lives in `answer-result-surface.tsx`; `document-results.tsx` re-exports it and owns `RelatedDocumentsPanel` (monolith imports both). `AnswerFeedbackType` moved to `lib/answer-feedback.ts` so `evidence-panels`, `visual-evidence`, and `answer-result-surface` no longer import types from `ClinicalDashboard`. `rendered-text-formatting.test.ts` corpus includes `answer-result-surface.tsx`. Clinical-note checklist rows link to primary sources when available.

#### Decomposition COMPLETE (approved move map)

All approved render-surface modules are extracted. `ClinicalDashboard.tsx` went from ~8.8k → ~4.7k lines and now holds the main `ClinicalDashboard` orchestrator, its data/state hooks, and the deferred admin surfaces only. The 6 extracted modules live in `src/components/clinical-dashboard/`: `auth-panel`, `answer-content`, `evidence-panels`, `output-panel`, `visual-evidence`, `document-results` (+ the shared `use-mobile-preview-sheet` hook and `display-text` helpers). The barrel `index.ts` was intentionally not extended.

**Deferred admin surfaces: DONE (2026-07-06).** `DocumentDrawer` + the label panels/helpers had already landed via #250/#251 (`document-admin.tsx`, wired). The remaining half-wired state was finished on `claude/dashboard-decomp-final`: `ToolsHub` + `MobileSectionFab` cut over to `dashboard-nav.tsx` and `SettingsDialog` (+ its 7 `Settings*` helpers) to `settings-dialog.tsx`. **Both #250 sibling files had drifted from the live monolith** (settings-dialog.tsx predated the auth-email sign-in flow; dashboard-nav.tsx had stale colour tokens and prop lists) and were regenerated verbatim from the current monolith blocks before wiring — reusable lesson: an orphaned prepared module is stale the moment the monolith copy keeps evolving; always re-diff before cutover. `global-mockup-search-shell.tsx` now imports `SettingsDialog` from the module. The dead `document-admin/` **directory** (shadowed by the live `document-admin.tsx` file in module resolution, imported by nothing) was deleted. Monolith: 4,373 → ~3,450 lines (orchestrator + data/state hooks + small render/stream helpers). Live-surface `data-testid`/`aria-label` corpus verified byte-identical across both moves.

## Phase 4 - Release maturity

- `npm run check:runtime` is the strict runtime gate and is now part of `npm run verify:cheap`, `npm run verify:ui`, and `npm run verify:release`; it fails outside Node 24.x or npm 11.x when run through npm.
- CI runs `npm run check:runtime` after dependency install so branch verification cannot silently drift away from Node 24.
- `npm run check:edge:functions` is the Deno type gate for the Supabase `indexing-v3-agent` Edge Function.
- `npm run check:document-label-coverage` is the live Supabase generated-label coverage gate. Run it after ingestion batches, document reclassification, or generated-label migrations; zero indexed documents may be missing generated `site` or `document_type` labels.
- Tune the full-browser CI cadence if release branches or weekly schedules prove too slow or too sparse.
- Add explicit review ownership for clinical source governance, outdated-source handling, incident review, and decommission decisions.
- Record production-readiness outcomes in release notes whenever clinical workflow, source governance, privacy, or deployment assumptions change.

## Visual regression, style contracts and the pre-merge performance budget (2026-07-30)

Three gates added for the "mature repo" verification pass. Full usage is in
[`docs/testing.md`](testing.md); this records the reasoning and the remaining debt.

- **Problem addressed.** Nothing verified rendered appearance. `playwright.visual.config.ts` and
  `npm run test:e2e:visual` existed but pointed at `ui-visual-artifacts.spec.ts`, which only
  `testInfo.attach()`es four screenshots for a human to eyeball — there was no `toHaveScreenshot`
  call and no baseline directory anywhere in the repo. Separately, ledger #094 showed a style
  contract passing while the style was inert, and Lighthouse only ran against the deployed origin,
  after a merge had already auto-deployed.
- **Style contracts are required and deterministic.** `tests/ui-style-contract.spec.ts` joins
  `test:e2e:pr` through `productionSpecPattern`, so it blocks like any other production journey. It
  is Chromium-only by design (computed-style serialisation is engine-specific) and self-skips on the
  other engines in the release matrix. `tests/style-contract-registry.test.ts` closes the inventory
  so the next unlayered class cannot be added unnoticed.
- **Verified it bites, not just that it passes.** The contract was re-run against a production build
  with `.search-band` deliberately moved back into `@layer components`; it failed on
  `borderTopWidth` as intended, and passed once reverted. A gate that has never been observed to
  fail is not yet evidence of anything.
- **Pixel baselines are advisory on purpose.** `visual-baseline` in CI is `continue-on-error` and
  outside `pr-required`. Two reasons: no baselines are committed yet (the first run's artifact is
  what supplies them), and this repo has already paid for a sub-pixel rounding flake — the
  `min-h-11` → `min-h-12` tap-target change. Promote by adding the job to `pr-required` and dropping
  `continue-on-error` in the same edit, once baselines have held across a few runs.
- **Baselines must come from CI, not a laptop.** Paths are platform-scoped
  (`tests/__screenshots__/{platform}/`). Font hinting and antialiasing differ between a developer
  machine and the `ubuntu-24.04` runner, so a locally-generated baseline would make every CI run red.
- **The performance budget is relative, not absolute.** `lighthouse-budget.json` holds a committed
  per-route baseline and a per-metric tolerance, following `check:bundle-budget`. Absolute
  web-vitals thresholds are meaningless against localhost with no network latency. Enforcement is
  enabled; incomplete evidence fails closed, and numeric breaches use an initial sample plus two
  targeted confirmations with a majority verdict.
- **The baseline is browser-specific, and the browser is now pinned (2026-08-08).** Each baseline row
  records the `chromeVersion` that produced it, and a mismatch fails closed — a browser bump is
  otherwise indistinguishable from an application regression. The ambient runner-image Chrome is not
  pinned per commit (the fleet served HeadlessChrome/150 and /151 to jobs minutes apart on
  2026-08-07), so both Lighthouse jobs resolve Playwright's managed Chromium through one shared
  composite action, `./.github/actions/setup-lighthouse-chromium`. Refreshing is a `workflow_dispatch`
  input (`refresh_lighthouse_baseline`) that uploads a rewritten `lighthouse-budget.json` for a human
  to review and commit; it deliberately cannot push, because a workflow that rewrites a gate's own
  baseline is a gate that can green itself.
- **The budget runs on perf scope, not the ui/build union (2026-08-08).** `perf_changed` in
  `scripts/ci-change-scope.mjs` excludes `worker/**` and container surfaces, dependency manifests and
  the lockfile, Playwright/test surfaces, most of `src/app/api/**` (except the initial-load handlers
  `/api/setup-status` and `/api/local-project-id`), and `src/app/mockups/**`. `src/proxy.ts` stays in
  scope because it runs before every budgeted navigation. The lockfile exclusion is the one
  deliberate hole on the PR arm: the classifier sees paths, never the lockfile diff, so it cannot
  tell a devDependency bump from a React/Next bump. The push-to-`main` arm re-runs when
  `lockfile_changed` is true, and `check:bundle-budget` still covers the same PRs. If a runtime dep
  bump ever lands an unnoticed LCP regression despite that, teach the classifier to read the lockfile
  diff — do not put the whole lockfile back into perf scope.
- **Verification debt remaining.** (1) No pixel baselines are committed, so `visual-baseline` reports
  rather than gates until an operator adopts them from the CI artifact. (2) The Lighthouse budget was
  promoted to an enforced `pr-required` dependency on 2026-08-13 after two complete pinned-Chromium
  baselines stayed within tolerance and #147's CLS breach was resolved. This relative local-production
  guard does not close #117's separate deployed-origin LCP work.
  (3) 37 of the 38 unlayered visual classes carry exemptions rather than effect contracts — the debt
  is enumerated in `STYLE_CONTRACT_EXEMPTIONS`, and ledger #094 stays open until the load-bearing
  ones have contracts. (4) `scripts/run-lighthouse-budget.mjs` duplicates roughly 50 lines of the
  isolated-server boot in `scripts/run-playwright.mjs`; extracting a shared module was deliberately
  deferred rather than destabilise the required UI gate in the same change.

## Text formatting and copy conventions

- **Document-derived text must never be rendered raw.** Any value pulled from an ingested document — answer prose, exact quotes, source snippets, document titles, image captions, extracted table text — must be routed through a `source-text-sanitizer` (`src/lib/source-text-sanitizer.ts`) or `display-text` (`src/components/clinical-dashboard/display-text.ts`) helper before it reaches JSX. Verbatim quotes use `sourceTextForVerbatimQuote`; titles use `cleanDisplayTitle`; snippets/captions use `sourceTextForCompactDisplay`.
- `normalizeExtractedGlyphs` is the shared, lossless glyph-repair primitive (ligatures, soft hyphens, zero-width/control chars). It is wired into the base `compactWhitespace`/`readableWhitespace` cleaners and into ingestion (`buildChunks`), so every formatter and newly-indexed chunk inherits it. It must never strip clinical meaning (numbers, units, dose strings, comparison symbols, hyphens, or legitimate bullet structure). It deliberately does **not** rejoin line-break hyphenation — a soft-wrap hyphen is indistinguishable from a real compound hyphen (`low-dose`, `twice-daily`), so fusing would corrupt clinical compounds and verbatim quotes.
- `tests/rendered-text-formatting.test.ts` is a static guard that fails if a known content surface reintroduces a raw interpolation. Extend it when adding new document-derived render surfaces.
- **Compact snippet polish** (2026-07-02): `stripClassificationBanner` removes PSPF protective-marking banners ("OFFICIAL", "OFFICIAL: Sensitive" — ALL-CAPS, line-anchored only) from compact/snippet/synopsis/title surfaces and from newly-built synopses; verbatim quotes keep banners by design. Inline bullet glyphs in compact previews become `"; "` separators (the `readableTableRows` joiner). `repairTruncatedCompactTail` repairs stored mid-word truncations ("where poss..."); ingestion now truncates synopses at word boundaries (`truncateAtWordBoundary` in `chunking.ts`), so this repair mainly serves pre-fix stored rows.
- **Static UI copy** (headings, empty states, error/toast messages, placeholders, starter prompts) lives in `src/lib/ui-copy.ts`, alongside `app-modes.ts` (mode labels) and `source-metadata.ts` (status labels). Do not hardcode new visible chrome copy inline.
- `scripts/backfill-text-normalization.ts` cleans already-stored `document_chunks` text in place using the same primitive. It is dry-run by default, requires `--write --confirm` to mutate, writes a revertible JSON backup first, and **never re-embeds** — existing vectors are frozen, so retrieval is unchanged by construction.

## Known limits

- Chromium UI coverage is active in CI on all branches; Firefox and WebKit run in the gated release-browser CI job and remain available locally through `npm run test:e2e` and `npm run verify:release`.
- The new accessibility media smoke verifies usability and layout in reduced-motion and forced-colors modes; it is not a full WCAG audit.
- The format gate intentionally ignores `.tmp-visual/` and `scratch/`; those folders are local investigation output, not release source.
- Process scripts do not commit, push, deploy, mutate Supabase data, or run dependency updates.
- `npm run check:indexing` includes local OCR prerequisites (`fitz`/PyMuPDF, `pytesseract`, and the Tesseract binary). A failure at that prerequisite step is local machine setup debt, not evidence that indexed production data or search behavior regressed.
- Supabase performance-advisor `unused_index` INFO items are monitored, not automatically fixed. Do not remove search/RAG support indexes until live query evidence, local explain/verification, and rollback planning show the index is safe to drop.

## Route sitemap guard (2026-07-03)

- Route, navigation, redirect, app-mode, registry-slug, and mockup-route changes must run `npm run docs:update` and `npm run sitemap:check` so `docs/site-map.md` stays aligned with `src/app`, `src/lib/app-modes.ts`, Services/Forms registry fixtures, Differentials, and medication detail routes.
- `npm run verify:cheap` now includes `npm run sitemap:check`; a stale sitemap is treated as process drift, not a documentation nicety.
- Keep `docs/site-map.md` as the human-readable route map for now. If it becomes too large for review, split into a concise `docs/site-map.md` summary plus a generated `docs/site-map.generated.md` inventory, and update `scripts/generate-site-map.ts` / `tests/site-map.test.ts` in the same change.

## Automatic documentation synchronization (2026-07-30)

- `npm run docs:update` regenerates `docs/site-map.md` and refreshes the exact `scripts/` file and
  `package.json` command counts in `docs/scripts-index.md`.
- `.githooks/pre-commit` runs the affected part of that update for staged route/catalog/mockup or
  script/package changes, and runs `docs:check-index` for staged app/lib/schema changes. Ordinary
  component-only commits avoid the sitemap generator. If generated or module-map documentation is
  still unstaged, the hook stops so the author can review and stage the diff. It never auto-stages
  or commits files. It also refuses mixed staged/unstaged generator inputs so the generated docs
  cannot accidentally describe work outside the commit. Use `SKIP_DOCS_SYNC_HOOK=1` only as an
  explicit one-commit bypass.
- `docs:check-inventory` is blocking in `verify:cheap` and CI, alongside `sitemap:check` and
  `docs:check-index`, so bypassing the local hook cannot merge stale generated facts.
- Semantic descriptions in `docs/codebase-index.md` and curated script grouping still require human
  judgment. The hook detects top-level module/route/schema gaps but does not invent architecture
  descriptions or ledger evidence.

## Retrieval RPC drift & indexing hygiene (2026-07-01)

- The four app-path hybrid retrieval RPCs (`match_document_chunks_hybrid`, `match_document_embedding_fields_hybrid`, `match_document_index_units_hybrid`, `match_document_memory_cards_hybrid` + its `_v2` core) had live-only performance fixes applied via raw SQL that were never captured in migrations, so a `supabase db reset` / branch DB reproduced the slow pre-fix shapes. Migration `20260701140631_codify_live_retrieval_rpcs` codifies the live definitions (validated byte-equivalent to live via whitespace-stripped `pg_get_functiondef` md5 before applying — a confirmed no-op on live), and `supabase/schema.sql` was reconciled to match. A clean replay now reproduces production retrieval.
- **Rule: never change a retrieval RPC (or any function) on the live project with raw `execute_sql`.** Go through a committed migration plus a `supabase/schema.sql` update. Raw-SQL edits are exactly how this drift accumulated.
- `search_schema_health()` runs an execution smoke (invokes each hybrid RPC with a zero vector) that surfaces through `npm run check:indexing`; it fails if an RPC regresses to an error state (e.g. the historical `42702` ambiguous-id break). This is the standing guard against the original bug class.
- **Migration `20260702014803_drop_legacy_vector_indexes` (applied 2026-07-02 with explicit user approval)** reclaimed ~4.4 GB of dead/duplicate vector indexes (embedding_fields ivfflat 3.66 GB @ 8 scans, chunks ivfflat 610 MB, index_units HNSW 640 MB @ 0 scans, plus dead btrees). Verified post-apply: all targets gone, `detect_legacy_ivfflat_indexes()` empty, DB 13 GB -> 8.6 GB, `search_schema_health()` ok. The documented follow-ups are done: `supabase/schema.sql` now declares the live-kept embedding-fields indexes (`owner_id_idx`, `source_chunk_id_idx`, `search_tsv_chunk_gin_idx`, `owner_document_created_idx`, `meta_rag_indexing_version_idx`) instead of the dropped ones, no longer creates the index_units HNSW index, and `tests/supabase-schema.test.ts` asserts the new shape. There is intentionally no HNSW index on `document_index_units.embedding` — re-add only if that RPC gains a vector-first candidate path.
- **`search_schema_health()` two-lineage divergence: RESOLVED** by `20260702021604_reconcile_search_schema_health_superset` (applied live 2026-07-02, verified `ok:true`). The single definition now carries the comprehensive signature checks (incl. `match_document_memory_cards_hybrid_v2`), the full 22-entry required-index list (post-drop: no index_units HNSW, memory_cards HNSW added; every entry verified present live before shipping), the legacy-ivfflat report, AND the hybrid-RPC execution smoke. schema.sql matches exactly (the migration is extracted from it).
- **Known follow-up debts (documented, not actioned):**
  - Live migration history has duplicate-version churn (two each of `api_rate_limits`, `audit_logs`, `rag_queries_retention`, `audit_logs_service_role_policy`, `indexing_reliability_recovery`) from the same raw-apply habit. Do not rewrite history; treat as a caution for future applies.
  - Auth server is capped at 10 absolute DB connections (Supabase advisor); switch to percentage-based allocation in the dashboard before scaling instance size (not settable via SQL/MCP). **Exact operator path + verification now documented: `docs/auth-connection-cap-runbook.md`** — the flip itself remains a pending operator dashboard action.
  - **`storage_cleanup_jobs` indexes: RESOLVED 2026-07-08** — `20260703030000` + `20260708000000_reapply_storage_cleanup_jobs_indexes` applied and verified on live (see `docs/archive/operator-decisions-2026-07-06.md`).

## Live database drift reconciliation (2026-07-05)

- **RESOLVED:** `indexing_v3_agent_jobs` table + `claim_indexing_v3_agent_jobs` + `update_indexing_v3_agent_job_status` were recorded as applied but absent on live. Migration `20260705230000_reconcile_live_database_drift` idempotently re-applied them; live verified post-push.
- **RESOLVED:** `match_document_embedding_fields_text` codified with service_role-only execute.
- **RESOLVED (2026-07-08):** `match_document_embedding_fields_text` owner-sentinel fix (`20260706130000`) applied to live; latent until the `_text` RPC is wired into app code.
- **RESOLVED:** `rag_visual_eval_*` tables codified with service_role-only RLS.
- **RESOLVED:** Live-only `20260705133000_tighten_search_document_chunks_owner_scope` mirrored in `schema.sql`.
- **RESOLVED (2026-07-08):** `indexing-v3-agent` edge function deployed (version 53, JSONB status-RPC parsing live — see `docs/archive/operator-decisions-2026-07-06.md`).
- **Operator-only:** publishable key rotation (`docs/archive/operator-decisions-2026-07-04.md`).

## Full-inventory drift detection & DR rehearsal (2026-07-07)

- `npm run check:drift` generalizes the `search_schema_health()` single-hash approach into a full-inventory comparison of every live function (normalized `pg_get_functiondef` hash + ACLs), index, RLS policy, table shape, constraint, trigger, view, and storage bucket against `supabase/schema.sql`. Expected state is `supabase/drift-manifest.json` (generated by `npm run drift:manifest`, which replays schema.sql from scratch into a Docker container — so schema.sql replayability is re-proven on every regeneration); known divergence lives in `supabase/drift-allowlist.json` with per-entry reasons. Offline halves (manifest freshness, migration↔schema.sql snapshot parity, allowlist hygiene, engine unit tests) run in `verify:cheap` via `tests/drift-detection.test.ts`. See [docs/database-drift-detection.md](database-drift-detection.md).
- The 2026-07-07 three-way audit (live vs schema.sql replay vs migration-chain replay) found 166 divergent keys: worker-written columns existing only on live (codified by `20260707000000`), schema.sql not replayable from scratch (fixed), pending migrations explaining 11 function-body drifts, `20260703030000` **recorded as applied but ineffective on live**, live-revoked authenticated grants, and a large legacy index estate. Full classified backlog in the drift doc.
- DR rehearsal completed: schema restore ≈ 19 s to a local container, `search_schema_health()` ok and all four hybrid RPCs proven on the restored copy with seeded vectors; measured RPO/RTO and the did-not-survive list are in [docs/disaster-recovery-runbook.md](disaster-recovery-runbook.md). Expand/contract policy for retrieval tables added to [docs/supabase-migration-reconciliation.md](supabase-migration-reconciliation.md).
- Migration `20260706200000_schema_drift_snapshot.sql` (the snapshot RPC) and `20260707000000_codify_live_observed_drift.sql` were **applied to live 2026-07-08** (see below).

### Pending-migration apply + retrieval-drift discovery (2026-07-08)

- **Applied to live** (via MCP `apply_migration`, each verified byte-faithful against a Docker replay, `search_schema_health` ok, site retrieval smoke green): `20260706010000` (search_schema_health M13 guard), `20260706130000` (embedding-fields-text owner sentinel — not app-called), `20260706200000` (schema_drift_snapshot RPC — enables `check:drift`), `20260707000000` (codify observed drift — no-op on live), and `20260708000000_reapply_storage_cleanup_jobs_indexes` (re-applies `20260703030000`'s effects, which were recorded-but-absent on live).
- **`20260705210000_retrieval_owner_filter_sentinel` was NOT applied and was NEUTRALIZED.** The pre-apply investigation found live has **diverged forward** from that migration's retrieval bodies via later raw-SQL work never captured in a migration: `match_document_chunks` carries an `hnsw.ef_search=100` plpgsql wrapper (higher vector recall), and `match_document_chunks_text` / `match_document_table_facts_text` carry richer multi-strategy implementations. Applying it would have **regressed live retrieval quality**. Its owner-sentinel purpose was already live and identical. The correct fix is forward-codification of the live bodies (drift backlog), not applying the old migration.
- **Live is under active concurrent multi-session editing** — during this work a new `corpus_topic_term_stats` function appeared and `search_schema_health` re-drifted minutes after apply. The drift allowlist is therefore an explicit point-in-time snapshot needing periodic regeneration.
- `apply_migration` records history rows under a current-UTC version with the passed name (documented churn), not the repo file's version number; re-applying the repo files later is a harmless idempotent no-op.

## PR merge gate: risk-scoped CI + required aggregate (2026-07-10)

- CI now has one always-reporting required aggregate: `CI / PR required`. The aggregate depends on `changes`, `static-pr`, `safety`, `coverage`, path-scoped `ingestion-sast`, `build`, `container-images`, `ui-critical-fast`, `ui-critical`, `lighthouse-budget`, and `db-reset-verify`, then enforces only the jobs whose scopes apply. The aggregate keeps `if: always()` and labels concurrency `cancelled` distinctly from real failures (#095 / PR #1409); it stays red because a skipped required check would count as passing.
- `static-pr` is the deterministic always-reporting baseline for every PR: runtime/install parity, scope and verification-plan self-tests, and changed-file formatting always run. Documentation and workflow-only scopes add focused contracts; executable or unknown scope adds lint, typecheck, coverage, and safety/config/RAG. Build, production UI, and migration replay remain independent jobs so reruns stay focused.
- `db-reset-verify` is path-scoped to Supabase migrations/schema/`src/lib/supabase` and drift tooling — not every API route. Do not also require an external Supabase Preview replay unless the repo owner intentionally wants duplicate migration replay.
- `ui-critical` retains its job ID for branch-protection compatibility. On pull requests / merge_group, it starts concurrently with `ui-critical-fast`; the fast job owns `@critical` and the duration-balanced shards exclude that subset, while `PR required` independently requires both. On main/schedule/ordinary dispatch, the fast job skips and the shards retain the complete production set. `src/app/api/**` does not set `ui_changed`; `.github/actions/setup-ui-e2e/**` does. `ui-advisory` runs quarantined and mockup journeys together when UI scope applies. A JUnit failure is considered a known flake only when its exact spec/title matches the validated ledger. The release browser backstop remains unconditional on release branches/manual/scheduled runs, is risk-scoped on `main`, and depends on static/build/UI success — not on `pr-required` — so a blocking scheduled dependency audit cannot skip Firefox/WebKit (#023 structural half). It does not pre-build because `run-playwright.mjs` owns the isolated build, and it avoids rerunning production Chromium after an in-run success.
- Secret Scan pins Gitleaks to the workflow event base/head SHAs and the checked-out commit (`scripts/run-gitleaks-pinned.mjs`) so a concurrent push cannot invalidate the range (#097).
- The 2026-07-13 cold-server and historical ledger candidates are tracked through the reproduction policy in `docs/testing.md`: run each three times on the same SHA, fix fail/pass races, treat deterministic failures as regressions, and remove entries that do not reproduce. On `0c56f27a3`, the historical composer/tap/answer-fallback entries and three cold-route candidates did not reproduce in three runs; the narrow differential viewport reproduced once in three cold runs, was fixed with route-specific readiness before its single submit, then passed three of three. The ledger is intentionally empty.
- Branch protection for `main` should require `CI / PR required` and `Secret Scan / Gitleaks`. The narrow blocking ingestion scan and perf-scoped Lighthouse budget are already enforced inside `PR required`; the Semgrep engine image is immutable, while its public registry rules remain mutable/network-backed and fatal tooling failures receive two bounded retries. Keep the separate advisory `SAST / Semgrep` context non-required. Container-affecting PRs are enforced through `CI / PR required`; do not separately require `Docker image build / app-image` or `Docker image build / worker-image`. Also do not require other path-filtered or scheduled/manual contexts such as `CI / Unit coverage`, `CI / Critical UI smoke`, `CI / Migration replay`, `CI / release-browser-matrix`, `Eval Canary`, or `Live drift check`; they can be skipped on ordinary PRs and would leave branches stuck at "Expected - Waiting for status to be reported."

## CSS cascade layering (2026-07-02)

- The custom component classes in `src/app/globals.css` predate cascade layers, so they sat unlayered and silently beat Tailwind v4 utilities (which live in `@layer utilities`) on the same element. This caused three shipped UI bugs: the header source ledger ignoring responsive `hidden`, the composer clear button covering typed text (`pr-*` defeated), and the standalone-home status chips sliding under the mode pill.
- Conflict-free helper classes (`app-edge-backdrop`, `mobile-app-shell`, `mobile-popover-scroll`, `citation-link`, `animate-skeleton-shimmer`, `focus-ring-premium`, `source-capsule-hover`, `polished-scroll`) now live in `@layer components`, so utilities override them normally. Their call sites were audited for same-property utility collisions before the move.
- **Header chrome now layered (2026-07-02):** `edge-glass-header` (+ responsive padding), `universal-header`, `universal-header-mode-button`, and `universal-header-icon-control` moved into `@layer components`. The header/mode-pill was the source of the recurring overlap+shadow bugs, so utilities on those elements now win. Reconciliation was three call-site shadow edits (drop the dead `shadow-[var(--shadow-tight)]` on the two `edge-glass-header` headers; drop `shadow-[var(--shadow-inset)]` on the mode button and the New-chat icon control so the layered class supplies the shadow directly). Proven byte-identical across 16 states with `scripts/capture-chrome-parity.ts`.
- **Verification tooling:** `scripts/capture-chrome-parity.ts` dumps `getComputedStyle` (incl. `::placeholder`/`::after`) for the header+composer chrome across home/answer/focus/document × mobile/desktop × light/dark and diffs two snapshots. **Gotcha:** it is only reliable once the dev server has fully settled on the current CSS — capture right after a hot-reload and it silently compares against the stale bundle. Always capture twice and confirm the two agree before trusting a diff.
- **Remaining debt (grew with PR #171) — pill portion resolved 2026-07-08:** the COMPOSER chrome (`answer-footer-search-*`, `universal-home-search-edge`/`universal-top-search-edge` (the home-composer edges), `document-mobile-search-pill`, `*-composer-edge`) was intentionally unlayered. #171's frosted rework pushed these from ~19 to ~92 computed-style conflicts, concentrated in the shared `ui-primitives` constants (`chatComposerShell/Input`, `chatSendButton`, `chatComposerIconButton`). The **pill surface** is now layered via a `chatComposerShell` base/delta split (next bullet); the pill-interior controls and the positioning chrome stay unlayered for the reasons below. When adding a utility to a still-unlayered composer-chrome element, check the class body first — the class wins.
- **Composer PILL surface now layered (2026-07-08):** the base/delta split shipped for the pill. `chatComposerShell` (the pill's shared `ui-primitives` constant) is split into `chatComposerShellBase` (utilities the pill class does NOT set — `flex items-center rounded-full border`) and `chatComposerShellDelta` (utilities the class ALSO sets — `min-h-14 gap-2 border-colour bg px-2 shadow focus-within:border`). `chatComposerShell` stays `base + delta` (byte-identical class set) for any non-layered caller. The pill call sites (`master-search-header.tsx`, `universal-search-command-mockups.tsx`) pass `chatComposerShellBase`, so `.answer-footer-search-pill` (+ `:hover`/`:focus-within`/`@640`) moved into `@layer components` with **zero computed-style change** (16/16 parity states byte-identical). The pill is a `<form>`, so no global element reset competes with it.
  - **Why the pill-interior controls (`answer-footer-search-input/-send/-action`) were NOT layered — and why the earlier "reverted, nothing shipped" attempt misread this:** the controls land on `<input>`/`<button>` elements, and `globals.css` has three **intentionally-unlayered** global resets that target those elements — `button,input,textarea,select { font: inherit }`, the `@media(max-width:640px)` 16px `font-size` floor (explicitly unlayered to beat `text-*` utilities), and `button,a,summary { transition-property: …; transition-duration: var(--duration-fast) }`. Unlayered rules beat **all** `@layer` rules, so an unlayered chrome control class wins by specificity (baseline), but moving it into `@layer components` drops it **below** those resets → the input reverts to inherited font (16px/400/24px instead of 18px/560/1.2) and the send button to the reset's transition (`var(--duration-fast)` ≈ 0.12s instead of the chrome 0.16s). A prior 2026-07-08 pass hit exactly this regression, reverted everything, and blamed "a Tailwind-v4 layer-ordering subtlety where a fresh `@layer components` block loses to `@layer utilities`." **That diagnosis was wrong:** the hand-authored `@layer components` block resolves correctly (utilities > components as intended — the pill proves it); the controls regressed because of the unlayered element resets, not layer order. Layering the controls also **gains nothing** — a `text-*` utility on the input can't beat the unlayered `font: inherit` either. So the controls (and their `chatComposerInput`/`chatSendButton`/`chatComposerIconButton` constants) stay unlayered/unsplit, exactly as baseline. Making them layerable would require moving the three global resets into `@layer base`, an app-wide change to every input/button that is out of scope here (and would break the 16px iOS floor's intent).
  - Also deliberately kept UNLAYERED: the composer POSITIONING chrome (`*-composer-edge`, `*-search-edge/-dock/-backdrop`, `-pill-open`, `document-mobile-search-*`, and every descendant-combinator override) — their conflicts are with inline responsive position utilities (not the shared constants) and are not parity-covered. `desktop-home-search-*` from the old debt note no longer exists in the code. `DocumentViewer`'s bottom composer is hand-rolled inline (no constants, no pill class) so it was untouched. Proven byte-identical across 16 states with `scripts/capture-chrome-parity.ts`. **Capture gotcha bit hard this pass:** Turbopack CSS HMR served the stale (pre-change) bundle after `git stash`, silently contaminating the diff in both directions; the reliable protocol is **kill server → `rm -rf .next` → fresh `ensure` → warm routes → capture** once per code state, then compare (never compare across an HMR CSS change on the same server).
- `tests/ui-overlap.spec.ts` is the standing regression guard for the visible symptom (overlapping header controls, composer clear-button geometry) across 640-1536px widths.

## Cross-browser test robustness under client-only rendering (2026-07-02)

- Making the dashboard and document viewer client-only via `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })` (PRs #144/#147) meant "page loaded" no longer implies "app mounted". Firefox/WebKit paint the client chunk later than Chromium, so three release-browser-matrix specs raced and failed on `main` while Chromium stayed green. All three were test-timing gaps, not product regressions — the app renders correctly in every browser.
  - `tests/ui-overlap.spec.ts`: `gotoHome` waited on `networkidle` (Playwright discourages it) and then measured the header, which had not mounted yet — every failure was `header#search not found` (count 0), never a real overlap. Now waits for `header#search` to be visible before measuring.
  - `tests/ui-tools.spec.ts` (forms detail → shared search): the shell re-synced its query from the URL on mount via `requestAnimationFrame`, which on Firefox/WebKit could land just after a programmatic `fill` and wipe the value (button stays disabled) or drop the submit before the router navigates. The fill-and-submit runs as one `toPass` unit that retries until the search routes. **Root-cause fix (see the 2026-07-03 follow-up below):** `GlobalMockupSearchShellClient` no longer uses a `requestAnimationFrame` sync at all — it seeds the composer mode/query from the URL and re-syncs only when the search string actually changes, so a mount-time frame can never wipe an in-progress fill.
  - `tests/ui-stress.spec.ts` (desktop evidence panel): the evidence `<details>` is opened by focusing its `<summary>` and pressing Enter; in CI WebKit the key event could fire before focus landed, so it never toggled. Now asserts `toBeFocused()` before pressing Enter.
- Rule of thumb for these client-only surfaces: never gate an interaction on `networkidle` or a bare `goto`. Wait for the specific mounted element, and wrap fill→submit→navigate races in `toPass` (the same idiom `openAppModeMenu`/`openDailyActions` already use). The `verify` + `ui-smoke` PR gates run Chromium only, so Firefox/WebKit-specific races surface solely in the gated `release-browser-matrix` (main/release/dispatch/schedule) — keep that job green rather than letting these re-accumulate.
- **Post-merge outcome (PR #178):** `ui-overlap` and `ui-stress` fixes verified green in CI WebKit. `ui-tools.spec.ts:264` (forms-detail search) still failed on **CI WebKit only** — the composer input stayed focused-but-empty and the submit disabled across the full retry, and it did **not** reproduce on local WebKit, so it couldn't be iterated locally. PR #186 added an interim `isDetailPage` guard to the mount `requestAnimationFrame` but stayed `[WIP]`, keeping a `if (browserName === "webkit") return;` early-return that ran only the **structural half** on WebKit.
- **Follow-up resolution (2026-07-03):** removed the `requestAnimationFrame` mount sync in `GlobalMockupSearchShellClient` entirely. The composer mode/query are now seeded from the URL at initial state, and a `lastSyncedSearchParamsRef` gates the re-sync effect so it fires **only when the search string actually changes** (a real navigation). Because typing never changes the URL and the initial mount is a no-op, no deferred frame can wipe an in-progress `fill` on a no-query detail route — the CI-WebKit-only race. This also retired the `isDetailPage`/`previousUrlHadQueryRef` special-casing from PR #186. With the race fixed at the source, the WebKit early-return and its comment were deleted from `ui-tools.spec.ts:264`, so all three browsers now verify the full submit-and-route wiring. Ruled out earlier (and still true): the inline `availableModeIds={["forms"]}` arrays are stable because those layouts are Server Components.

## Suspense fallback must not re-render page children (2026-07-02)

- `GlobalMockupSearchShell` (aka `GlobalSearchShell`, used by the `forms`/`services`/`favourites`/`medications` layouts) wrapped `GlobalMockupSearchShellClient` in a `<Suspense>` whose **fallback also rendered `props.children` inside `#main-content`** — the same subtree the client body renders. Because `useSearchParams()` forces that boundary to the fallback on the server, the page subtree was emitted twice and both copies could persist, producing duplicate `id="main-content"` and duplicate `data-testid` on every shell page. It surfaced as `ui-smoke.spec.ts:1103` failing with a strict-mode violation (two `data-testid="acamprosate-medication-page"` `<main>` elements on `/medications/acamprosate`).
- Fix: the Suspense fallback renders a **neutral placeholder only** — never `props.children`. Rule: do not render the resolved content inside its own Suspense fallback; the fallback is a loading state, not a second copy of the page.

## useSearchParams Suspense must not wrap route children (2026-07-26)

- Removing `ClientHydrationBoundary` around standalone shell `{children}` restored mode-home RSC paint, but left route segments nested inside the shell’s `useSearchParams()` Suspense. Next streamed the page root into a hidden completion template (`<div hidden id="S:N">`) while the live shell also mounted the same `data-testid` root. Playwright’s strict `getByTestId` counts hidden nodes, so Production UI failed on `/forms`, `/favourites`, and differentials presentations under CI load even though the a11y tree showed one `main`.
- Portal ready-gating fixed React #418 (hydration) but not this duplicate-root class.
- Fix: `isAlwaysStandaloneShellPath` skips the outer searchParams Suspense for namespaced routes; standalone chrome reads params via a mount-gated `ShellSearchParamsBridge` sibling so `{children}` stay outside that boundary. Keep mode-home RSC paint; do not restore full-shell `ClientHydrationBoundary`.

## Clinical registry tables applied live (2026-07-03)

- **Migration `20260703020000_clinical_registry_records.sql` (applied live 2026-07-03 with explicit user approval)** created `public.clinical_registry_records` (owner-scoped structured Services/Forms records — 30 cols, JSONB render payloads, conservative `source_status`/`validation_status` governance columns) and the `public.clinical_registry_record_sources` join table (record ↔ verifying corpus document, FK cascade). Both are service-role-only RLS (enabled + revoked from anon/authenticated + a single `for all to service_role` policy); ownership is enforced in the API layer, matching the documents model. Verified post-apply: both tables present with correct columns, RLS enabled, 0 rows; `get_advisors(security)` returns no lints. `supabase/schema.sql` mirrors the migration and `tests/supabase-schema.test.ts` asserts the shape.
- **Version-recording nuance:** the MCP `apply_migration` timestamps the history row in UTC, so live recorded the migration as version `20260702183308` (name `clinical_registry_records`) while the repo file is `20260703020000_...` (Australia/Perth date). Because the migration is fully idempotent (`create table/index if not exists`, `drop trigger/policy if exists` + create), a later `supabase db push` re-applying the repo file is a harmless no-op that only adds a second history row — the same known duplicate-version churn already present in live history. Do not rewrite history to reconcile; treat as a caution.
- **Remaining step (user):** seed the registry per owner with `npm run registry:seed -- --owner-id <uuid> --write --confirm`. Until seeded, authenticated users see the honest empty-registry state; demo/env-less deployments are unaffected. See [[PR #209]].

## Nondeterministic "unsupported" retrieval — finding #11 needs Phase 2 (2026-07-03)

- **Symptom (rag-hybrid-findings finding #11):** valid clinical topics phrased as bare low-confidence queries ("bipolar disorder", "anorexia management") intermittently return 0 results (`unsupported_short_circuit`) instead of an answer.
- **Root cause (confirmed live):** the soft-tail branch of `shouldShortCircuitUnsupportedSearch` (`src/lib/rag/rag.ts`) fires on `analysis.queryClass === "unsupported_or_general"`, and that class is set by `analyzeQueryWithClassifierFallback`, which calls a **generative LLM classifier** (6s timeout, `reasoningEffort:"low"`, uncached) for low-confidence queries. That call is nondeterministic: it reclassifies "bipolar disorder" to a supported class on some runs (→ answered) and declines/times-out on others (→ short-circuited to 0). Reproduced with a same-process ×N probe.
- **Why a clean Phase-1 fix does NOT exist:** the deterministic analyzer carries **no signal** distinguishing in-corpus topics from out-of-corpus (bipolar, anorexia, gout, DKA all produce identical `unsupported_or_general`, confidence ≈ 0.40, `canonicalTerms` = query tokens). Only the corpus can tell them apart. Removing the soft-tail short-circuit fixes the valid topics but **regresses `unsupported_correct_rate` 1.0 → 0.79** on `eval:quality --rag-only`: a lexical distinctive-term relevance gate in `chooseAnswerRoute` either over-refuses legitimate semantic/vector matches (whose exact term is not in the retrieved text — e.g. the `rag-routing.test.ts` "admission" fixtures) or under-refuses invented terms ("florbizone syndrome") that score strongly on generic scaffolding words ("syndrome"/"management"). The corpus is broad (gout 13 / crohn 49 / appendicitis 30 / angioplasty 32 / bipolar 719 chunks), so almost no common medical term is truly absent — grounded low-confidence answers, not fabrication, are the realistic worst case for real terms; only genuinely invented terms should refuse.
- **Decision (2026-07-03):** the risky change (soft-tail removal + relevance gate + invented-term eval controls) was **reverted**; only a safe, independent hardening was kept — `fetchEnabledRagAliases` no longer caches `[]` on a transient `rag_aliases` read error (which would suppress alias expansion for the whole TTL). Finding #11 is **re-scoped into RAG optimisation Phase 2** ("fit retrieval to content"), where it should be fixed with corpus-grounded relevance — IDF/corpus-frequency weighting of query terms and/or the semantic relevance model, plus the data-driven query-understanding vocabulary (RC6) so the deterministic classifier recognises in-corpus topics up front. Any gate must keep `eval:quality --rag-only` `unsupported_correct_rate` at 1.0 (add invented-term controls like "florbizone syndrome management" / "quxbyria disorder treatment" once it can pass them) while letting valid bare topics answer. A cheaper interim option worth measuring first: **classifier-verdict memoization** to at least make the current behaviour deterministic per query.
- **RESOLVED (2026-07-07, `claude/retrieval-correctness`):** the Phase-2 corpus-grounded fix shipped. `corpus_topic_term_stats` (migration `20260707100000`, applied live) reports per-term title-topic membership (with a measured 5% genericity ceiling — "management"/"guideline" headline ~18–20% of titles and are scaffolding; real topics ≤3%) and chunk-level presence, scoped with the exact retrieval `owner_filter`. `src/lib/corpus-grounding.ts` + the `analyzeQueryWithClassifierFallback` hook classify only the soft-tail branch (pattern-guarded refusals and higher-confidence classes untouched): in-corpus bare topics deterministically reclassify to `broad_summary` and answer; corpus-absent queries skip the LLM and refuse deterministically (trigram correction still runs); inconclusive keeps memoized-LLM behaviour; DB errors fail open. Verified live: "bipolar disorder" / "anorexia management" answer 4/4 runs with the right document at rank 1 (new golden cases `bare-topic-bipolar` / `bare-topic-anorexia`); "florbizone syndrome management" / "quxbyria disorder treatment" refuse 4/4 runs (new `ragEvalCases` controls); golden eval 36/36.

## Retrieval changes must pass the golden eval before merge (2026-07-03)

- **Any PR that touches retrieval, ranking, selection, chunking, or scoring MUST run `npm run eval:retrieval:quality` (36/36) locally before merge** and paste the summary in the PR. CI cannot run it (it needs live Supabase + OpenAI keys), so it is a manual gate — now a checkbox in the PR template.
- **Why (measured):** PR #118 caught a main-side change (uncapped candidate score + blanket source-governance metadata weighting in `retrieval-selection.ts`) that regressed the golden set 23/23 → 16/23 (doc-recall@5 1.0 → 0.76) on the partially-enriched corpus. `verify:cheap` was green throughout — only the golden retrieval eval surfaced it. Unit tests do not exercise live ranking, so they cannot substitute.
- **Standing constraint (do not relearn):** source-governance metadata (`document_status`/`clinical_validation_status`/`extraction_quality`) must NOT weight retrieval **selection ordering**, and candidate relevance scores must stay clamped. Live scores saturate at 1.0 and the corpus is only partially enriched (unenriched → unknown/unverified), so metadata weighting buries correct documents. Governance belongs in ranking penalties and the answer/source-governance layer. See [[no-governance-weighting-in-retrieval-selection]] and `docs/rag-hybrid-findings-and-todo.md` (RC8).
- **Answer-generation changes** (synthesis prompt, post-processing) additionally run `eval:rag --limit 15` + `eval:quality --rag-only` (grounded-supported must not drop; citation-failure 0). A new opt-in `npm run eval:answer-quality` reports a structural per-intent **targeting** metric (informational) for measuring how precisely answers hit the asked question.

## Audit P2/P3 follow-up (2026-07-06)

- **P0 carry-over (PR #278 / `cursor/audit-p2-p3-hardening-b54f`):** RAG cache owner/indexing-version guards, synopsis parity in ranking/detectors, DELETE TOCTOU re-check, worker cache invalidation on job completion, and `RAG_QUERY_HASH_SECRET` required in production-like readiness checks.
- **P2 M13:** `20260702000000_commit_generation_preserve_legacy_artifacts.sql` must be applied to live Supabase before reindex commits can safely purge legacy NULL-generation rows. After apply, run `npm run check:m13-migration`, `npm run reindex:health`, and `npm run check:indexing`. `search_schema_health()` now reports `commit_document_index_generation.preserve_legacy_artifacts_migration` when the live function body is stale.
- **P2 upload hardening:** `/api/upload` consumes the `document_upload` rate-limit bucket (12/min owner, 3/min anonymous).
- **P3 dispositioned (no code change):** L9 searchable-only `image_count` (documented in `worker/main.ts`); L11 triple `readFile` peak-memory trade-off (documented at the ingestion site); L18 duplicate `audit_logs` policy in an already-applied migration (do not edit applied migrations — consolidate only if migrations are ever squashed).
- **L19 RESOLVED — CSP `script-src` nonce migration (branch `claude/csp-nonce-migration`).** Production `script-src` is now `'self' 'nonce-<per-request>' 'strict-dynamic'` (no `'unsafe-inline'`, no `'unsafe-eval'`); the nonce is generated per request in `src/proxy.ts`, threaded into SSR via the `x-nonce` + CSP request headers, and applied to Next's own bootstrap/bundle/flight scripts automatically plus the one hand-authored inline script (theme-flash guard in `src/app/layout.tsx`). Every other CSP directive and security header is unchanged; the static (non-CSP) headers still come from `next.config.ts` → `buildSecurityHeaders`. **Development keeps the pre-migration `'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'` (no `'strict-dynamic'`)** because the Turbopack dev server injects non-nonced HMR/route-chunk `<script>` tags that `'strict-dynamic'` would block. **Dedicated UI verification (why L19 was deferred):** `npm run build`, full-Chromium `npm run verify:ui`, and a scripted prod-server (`next start`) console sweep of answer / search / document-viewer / auth flows confirming **zero** `securitypolicyviolation`. That sweep surfaced a pre-existing (already blocked under the old prod policy) benign eval violation from Zod 4's JIT probe (`new Function("")` in a swallowed try/catch); it is silenced by setting Zod `jitless` on the client in `src/instrumentation-client.ts` (server keeps JIT — no CSP there).

## Design convergence & type-scale ratchet (2026-07-06)

- **`docs/design-system/README.md` is now the front door** for all UI work: token contract, type-scale rules, z-index ladder, Sheet-only modals, a11y requirements, and the UI Definition of Done. [`docs/design-system.md`](./design-system.md) remains live-layer notes during the v1→v2 transition. The `docs/redesign/*` documents remain the deep references they link to.
- **Type-scale ratchet — backlog cleared, gate now strict:** `node scripts/check-type-scale.mjs --strict` reports **0 hits / 0 files** (this pass retires the last 8 hits in 1 file; the prior recorded baseline was 20/9, originally 168/22). The compact mode-home hero now uses the shared fluid `--text-hero` scale; the temporary mode-home-only aliases were removed after confirming no consumers remained. `check:type-scale --strict` is wired into `verify:cheap` (package.json), so any newly introduced arbitrary `text-[<n>px|rem|em]` size now fails the gate — UI PRs must keep the count at zero. Colour utilities (`text-[color:var(--…)]`) are the sanctioned token form and are not counted.
- **Cleared this pass:** dead launcher mobile detail rows now expand (aria-expanded disclosures); launcher detail dialog migrated to the `Sheet` primitive (focus trap/return-focus restored); launcher filter tablists gained `aria-controls` + a `role="tabpanel"` results region; styled `src/app/not-found.tsx` added (the `notFound()` calls in differentials no longer fall through to the unstyled default); `?page=abc` NaN leak in the document viewer clamped; `/services` off-palette preview deleted (dead export) and the live navigator's residual hardcodes tokenized; launcher icon tones moved from raw Tailwind palette classes to categorical `--type-*` / semantic danger triads (dark-mode + forced-colors correct); mockups layout emits `robots: noindex`.

## Repository hygiene + production surface pass (2026-07-06)

- **Mockup routes gated out of production:** `/mockups/*` (27 design-exploration pages) previously shipped in production builds, hidden only by a `robots.ts` disallow. `src/app/mockups/layout.tsx` now calls `notFound()` unless `mockupsEnabled()` (`src/lib/env.ts`) — always on in dev/test, production requires explicit `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCKUPS_ENABLED=true`. Verified end-to-end: production build serves HTTP 404 on mockup routes and 200 on real routes; `tests/env-mockups-gate.test.ts` guards the flag logic.
- **Dependency vulnerability gate in CI:** the `verify` job now runs `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` after runtime alignment. Rationale: the document parsers (`pdf-parse`, `pdfjs-dist`, `mammoth`, `exceljs`, `jszip`) process untrusted uploads, so high/critical advisories in the production tree should block merges rather than wait for the weekly Dependabot pass.
- **Scratch artifacts untracked:** 24 committed `.tmp-visual/` files (visual-QA capture scripts + PNGs) removed from tracking; `.tmp-visual/` added to `.gitignore` (it was already Prettier-ignored).
- **Docs archived:** superseded/completed planning docs moved to `docs/archive/` — root `COLOR_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` (superseded), `TOOLS_CONTEXT_FOR_NEW_CHAT.md` + `design-qa.md` (chat handoffs referencing machine-local paths), the completed `search-rag-phase-0…5.5b` + pre-phase-2 series, and the completed `clinical-chat-ui-*` phase docs. Living docs (`search-rag-master-plan.md`, `search-rag-master-context.md`, `clinical-chat-ui-component-map.md`) stay in `docs/`; no inbound references were broken (verified by repo-wide grep) and relative links inside moved files were retargeted.
- **Playwright port-finder IPv6 fix:** superseded — an equivalent fix landed on `main` first (`71e0ab0`, which also adds a Chromium executable override); `main`'s version is kept in the merge.

## Universal search workstream — verification state (2026-07-06)

- **Shipped on `claude/universal-search-algorithm-ryrps7`:** finding #11 interim fix (classifier-verdict memoization, 15-min TTL, errors not memoized — the "cheaper interim option" from the 2026-07-03 entry above), pre-clamp tiebreak completion in `selectRetrievalEvidence`, weak-match OR-augmentation (kill switch `RAG_TEXT_WEAK_OR_RELAXATION=false`), `similarity_origin` telemetry, shared `catalog-search` primitives replacing the four per-domain rankers, forms mode-kind honesty, tools dataset dedupe, `/api/search/universal` federated endpoint, and the cross-entity typeahead in `UniversalSearchCommandSurface`.
- **Eval debt (blocking merge, not development):** `npm run eval:retrieval:quality` (23/23) and `eval:quality --rag-only` (`unsupported_correct_rate` 1.0) could NOT be run in the authoring environment (no live keys) — they MUST be run before merge per the standing gate above, with special attention to the weak-match OR-augmentation (flag off restores relax-on-empty exactly) and the retrieval-selection tiebreak (tie-only by construction).
- **Eval debt settled 2026-07-07 — both flagged changes had regressed the golden eval (31/34 on main).** Isolated case-by-case against the same live corpus (pre-#325 code passed all 3): the weak-match OR-augmentation buried `opioid-withdrawal-doses` (docRecall@5 → 0; OR recall is append-only at the RPC merge but NOT after re-ranking), and the `selectRetrievalEvidence` pre-clamp tiebreak buried `alcohol-ciwa-threshold` + `clozapine-cbc-abbreviation-threshold` (boost-stacking magnitude re-ordered saturated top-5 sets). Fixed on `claude/retrieval-correctness`: `RAG_TEXT_WEAK_OR_RELAXATION` now defaults to `false` (opt-in experiment flag; re-enable only behind a fresh full golden run) and the selection-layer tiebreak is removed — the pre-clamp deep tiebreak lives in `rankClinicalResults` (below the engineered `rankingTieBreakScore`), which is the only place it is eval-proven. Lesson reinforced: "tie-only by construction" still changes which tied candidate wins; ordering changes inside saturated score regions are behavior changes and need the golden gate.
- **UI verification run:** new `tests/ui-universal-search.spec.ts` (grouped typeahead renders, item selection navigates, Enter still runs the mode search — universal endpoint mocked), full `ui-tools`/`ui-tools-task-directory` (40/40) and `ui-smoke`/`ui-overlap` suites against a live dev server in demo mode, plus a live curl of `/api/search/universal` (grouped payload, domain filter, 400 on short query).
- **Known limitation:** the typeahead spec mocks the universal endpoint; an end-to-end spec against live seeded registries needs the owner-auth Playwright project (E2E*USER*\* keys).

## Cross-mode answer links workstream — verification state (2026-07-06)

- **Shipped on `claude/search-cross-mode-links-qscj1n`:** post-answer "Also in your library" strip (`src/lib/cross-mode-links.ts` + `CrossModeLinksStrip`), thread-wide entity fallback, word-boundary field matching in `rankCatalogRecords` (substring hits like "renal" inside "adrenaline" no longer count as name/title matches), `fields=index` slim mode on `/api/medications`, cross-mode click telemetry via `/api/search/interaction` (`crossMode` target, `metadata.interaction: "cross_mode_link_open"`), the same strip on documents-mode results, and answer `crossModes` command-surface parity.
- **Verification debt:** `npm run verify:release` (and its governance/eval gates) has not been run for this workstream — the authoring environment has no live Supabase/OpenAI keys. Run it from a secrets-equipped environment after merge; the cross-mode surface itself is additive/navigational, so `verify:cheap` + `verify:ui` are the load-bearing local gates.
- **Telemetry note:** cross-mode clicks write `rag_query_misses` rows with `clicked_document_id: null` and the target mode/slug in `metadata`; retrieval-quality reviews that aggregate misses by document should filter on `metadata.interaction`.

## rag.ts decomposition — part 1 (2026-07-06)

- **Shipped on `claude/rag-decomp` (moves 1–4 of the approved 8-move sequence, all verbatim move-only):** quote-verification family → `rag-quote-verification.ts`; source-block family (`buildRagSourceBlock`, `truncateForModel`, table formatters) → `rag-source-block.ts`; numeric-verification application (`applyNumericVerification`, `unboldUnverifiedNumbers`) → `answer-verification.ts` beside the primitives it wraps; model-context selection (`capPerDocumentCrowding`, `selectModelContextResults`) → `rag-context-selection.ts`. Four tiny shared helpers re-homed to domain siblings (`allowedChunkMap` → citations, `safeRecord`/`metadataText` → rag-answer-text, `appendRoutingReason` → rag-routing); rag.ts's `resultCitation` was an exact duplicate of `citations.citationFromResult` and now aliases it. All extractions are cycle-free (modules import one-way from siblings; rag.ts re-exports moved names its tests/consumers import). rag.ts 7,874 → ~7,450 lines.
- **Measured coupling for the remaining moves (do not trust the pre-drift map):** the extractive-answer family (L, ~1,085 lines) and the answer-quality/reasoning-effort family (M, ~465 lines) are **mutually entangled** on main (M calls `classifyAnswerIntent`/`boldHighYieldClinicalText` from L; L calls `finalQualityGapAnswer`/`isFragmentLikeClinicalAnswer`/`hasBadFinalAnswerQuality` from M) and both reach into the coverage-gate helpers (K) — extract L+M together in a dedicated pass, or accept module→rag.ts back-edges. Retrieval variants (H) additionally depend on owner-scope helpers (`assertGlobalSearchAllowed`, `ownerScopeForDocumentFilteredRetrieval`) and live alias fetching; context packing (J) depends on `stableHash` + committed-generation helpers and belongs with the cache region (F) move.
- **Standing gate:** any continuation that touches H/F (retrieval-side) must pass `npm run eval:retrieval:quality` (23/23) before merge, per the golden-eval rule above.

## rag.ts decomposition — part 2 (2026-07-07)

- **Base:** branched `claude/rag-decomp-part2` off `origin/main` (8878151aa, includes part-1 #341 + retrieval-correctness #343 → golden set is now **36**, not the 23 the part-1 note recorded). Approved 3-move sequence: (1) L+M together, (2) retrieval variants H, (3) context-packing J → cache F. Method identical to part 1 (verbatim byte-identical block moves, one module per commit, per-move gate). The remeasured region map (do NOT trust part-1's line numbers post-drift): L = extractive-answer at 3954–5039 (1,085 lines) and M = answer-quality/reasoning-effort at 5040–5503 (464 lines), confirming part-1's family sizes.
- **Move 1 (shipped): L+M → `rag-extractive-answer.ts`.** Lines 3954–5503 moved verbatim (empty block diff modulo the `export` keyword added to 9 functions that now cross the boundary). Extracting L+M **together** keeps their mutual entanglement internal → no cross-module cycle between them. rag.ts imports the 12 names it still calls, re-exports the 6 tests import. Per the sanctioned "accept back-edges" path, the module imports **9 call-time helpers back from rag.ts** (`evidenceTextForGate`, `rankMemoryCardsForAnswer`, `deriveConfidence`, `scoreValue`, `machineReadableFallbackAnswer`, `buildAnswerScoreExplanations`, `buildIndexingQuality`, `collectMemoryCards`, `fallbackReasonFromRouting`) — a rag.ts↔module cycle that is runtime-safe (all uses are call-time; no `import/no-cycle` lint rule). 6 of those 9 gained an `export` keyword; the aliased `citationFromResult as resultCitation` import travels with the module; 5 imports orphaned by the move were removed from rag.ts. rag.ts 7,550 → 6,025 lines. Gate: tsc clean (56 pre-existing `fast-check` property-test errors only — `fast-check` is not installed in the shared node_modules; no new errors from the move), focused vitest 75/75, lint (only the 7 pre-existing rag.ts unused-import warnings; module 0), prettier clean.
- **Trap logged:** a backgrounded `tsc … | tail; echo EXIT` reports the pipeline's (echo's) exit, not tsc's — always read the captured EXIT marker, never trust the background "exit 0" notification. This masked both the true baseline (56 fast-check errors) and move 1's first-cut breakage (9 unexported functions + a missed aliased import) until vitest failed.
- **Move 2 (shipped): retrieval variants H → `rag-retrieval-variants.ts`.** Lines 1999–2283 moved verbatim (empty block diff modulo the `export` keyword added to 5 declarations): `buildRetrievalQueryVariants`, alias normalize/expand + live `fetchEnabledRagAliases`, `assertGlobalSearchAllowed`/`ownerScopeForDocumentFilteredRetrieval`, `shouldRelaxWeakTextMatches`, `textCandidateBudgetForQueryClass`, budget consts. rag.ts imports the 11 names it calls, re-exports the 6 `retrieval-query-variants.test.ts` imports. Back-edges: `SearchChunksArgs` (type-only, no runtime cycle) + `shouldShortCircuitUnsupportedSearch` (one call-time value fn, gained an `export`; belongs to the soft-tail family staying in rag.ts). 4 orphaned imports removed from rag.ts. rag.ts 6,025 → 5,750 lines. Gate: tsc clean, focused vitest 102/102 (incl. `retrieval-query-variants.test.ts`), lint (7 pre-existing warnings only), prettier clean.
- **Move 3 (shipped, final): cache region F + context-packing J → `rag-cache.ts`.** Cache is interleaved in rag.ts with the query-classifier, unsupported-soft-tail, and query-expansion regions, so this was a **multi-region verbatim move** (4 contiguous regions assembled into one module, each byte-identical to source; diff shows only the `export` keyword on 11 boundary-crossing declarations): cache maps/consts + cache-key helpers + main cache block (get/set answer+search, shared-cache, `stableHash`, `retrievalPlanCacheQuery`, invalidation) + context-packing. rag.ts imports the 12 names it calls (incl. the `answerInflight` map) and re-exports 4 (`invalidateRagCachesForOwner`/`…ForDocumentMutation` for API routes; `packedContextCacheKey`/`retrievalPlanCacheQuery` for tests). Back-edges: `SearchChunksArgs` + `SearchTelemetry` (type-only) and one call-time value fn `retrievalPlanForQueryClass` (gained `export`). Notably the interleaved classifier/soft-tail/expansion helpers are cleanly _not_ referenced by the cache union — only those 3 back-edges. 3 orphaned imports removed. rag.ts 5,750 → 5,108 (**7,550 → 5,108 across part 2, −2,442 / −32%**; the file now holds the orchestrator + retrieval-diagnostics + classifier + coverage-gate + memory/enrichment + logging). Gate: tsc clean, focused vitest 118/118, lint (7 pre-existing warnings only; module 0), prettier clean.
- **Golden retrieval eval environment-blocked — root cause is a data/owner mismatch, not code or OpenAI:** `npm run eval:retrieval:quality` FAILS ~36/36 with every retrieval layer at 0 (`text_candidates:0`, `hybrid_vector:0`, …). Proven not a regression: pristine `origin/main` rag.ts (moved modules inert) reproduces the **byte-identical** failure output (24/24 printed cases, latency aside). Direct Supabase probe with the configured service key: **2,065 documents / 69,334 chunks present, but `owner_id` is `null` (global) on the sampled docs while `RAG_EVAL_OWNER_ID` (2bac05f1-…) owns 0**, and owner-scoped retrieval now **fail-closes** on a null owner (privacy hardening) — so no owner value retrieves the null-owner corpus and the eval returns 0 candidates. Restoring OpenAI credits fixed embeddings (`embedding:1` succeeds) but not this. To run a real 36/36, the corpus docs must be assigned to the eval owner (or the eval must target the actual owner / allow global search). Behavior preservation for moves 1–3 is evidenced by byte-identical moves + tsc + focused vitest + **pristine-eval equivalence**; the mandated clean 36/36 + `eval:quality --rag-only` must run once the eval-owner/corpus config is fixed (or in CI), before merge. **RESOLVED 2026-07-07** — the eval now defaults its owner to the public sentinel and the mandated clean **36/36, failed_cases=0** ran green against the live corpus (see "Golden retrieval eval owner default = public sentinel" below); this closes the #347 part-2 eval debt.

## Golden retrieval eval owner default = public sentinel (2026-07-07)

- **Fix committed:** the golden retrieval eval now defaults its owner to the public-owner sentinel
  `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` (`DEFAULT_EVAL_OWNER_ID` in `scripts/eval-retrieval.ts`,
  applied as the final fallback after env/CLI/email resolution). Since the 2026-07-06 public
  promotion the live corpus is entirely `owner_id = NULL`; `retrieval_owner_matches` maps the
  sentinel to NULL-owner rows, mirroring anonymous production search, so **no future session has to
  set `RAG_EVAL_OWNER_ID` by hand**. An explicit `RAG_EVAL_OWNER_ID` / `LOCAL_NO_AUTH_OWNER_ID` /
  `RAG_EVAL_OWNER_EMAIL` (or `--owner-id` / `--owner-email`) still overrides it — the email-lookup
  path is preserved. Change is localized to eval config + docs; retrieval/ranking/app runtime code
  is untouched. This is the fix the retrieval-correctness workstream (#343) established and the
  runbook already recommended; it makes that recommendation the committed default.
- **Offline gates (2026-07-07):** `npm run typecheck` clean; `npm run verify:cheap` green
  (`check:runtime`, `sitemap:check`, lint — 8 pre-existing warnings, 0 errors — typecheck, unit
  tests 1251 passed / 3 skipped).
- **Live 36/36 CONFIRMED (2026-07-07):** ran `npm run check:supabase-project` (live mode against
  `Clinical KB Database` / `sjrfecxgysukkwxsowpy`) then `npm run eval:retrieval:quality` with the
  new default owner (no `RAG_EVAL_OWNER_ID` set). Result: **`cases=36`, `failed_cases=0`,
  `latency_failed_cases=0`**, `document_recall@5=1`, `content_recall@5=1`, `top_k_hit_rate=1`,
  `mrr@10=0.8148`, `content_mrr@10=0.9244`, strategies `{text_fast_path:25, document_lookup_fast_path:1,
hybrid:10}`, all 10 forced-embedding vector cases passed (`force_embedding_failure_count=0`). A
  direct read-only DB probe confirmed the premise: all **2,065** documents have `owner_id = NULL`;
  the old eval owner `2bac05f1-…` owns 0. **This closes the retrieval half of the #347 part-2 eval
  debt** — the golden retrieval eval is the retrieval behavior-preservation proof, and it now runs
  green with no manual owner setup. (#347 also owed `eval:quality -- --rag-only`; that answer-path
  half was still owner-blocked until the follow-up below.)

## Eval-owner default hoisted to all read/eval scripts + #347 answer-path gate closed (2026-07-08)

- **Follow-up to the 2026-07-07 fix above.** PR #348 only patched `eval-retrieval.ts`, so
  `eval:quality` (incl. `--rag-only`), `eval:rag`, `eval:answer-quality`, and `eval:search` still
  resolved the owner as `args.ownerId ?? emailLookup ?? undefined` and returned 0/N against the
  all-public corpus — the exact failure #348 fixed for retrieval, still live for the answer path.
- **Fix (item 1 + 3):** hoisted `DEFAULT_EVAL_OWNER_ID` + `resolveEvalOwnerId(supabase, args)` into
  the shared `scripts/eval-utils.ts` and applied it at the final owner-resolution point in all five
  read/eval scripts (`eval-retrieval` refactored onto it; its local duplicate constant removed).
  Precedence preserved (explicit id → email lookup → sentinel); the helper prints a **one-line
  warning on the sentinel fallback** so the narrowing to public-only scope is visible, not silent.
  Write/backfill scripts (`enrich-documents`, `classify-documents`, `backfill-*`) deliberately
  excluded — defaulting an owner there could write under the wrong owner. First-ever
  `resolveEvalOwnerId` unit coverage added to `tests/eval-utils.test.ts`.
- **Gates:** `verify:cheap` green (1277 tests; 0 lint errors). `eval:retrieval:quality` re-ran
  **36/36, failed_cases=0** on the refactored script (regression check). The fallback warning was
  observed firing in a real `eval:quality` run.
- **#347 answer-path gate CLOSED (item 2) — `eval:quality -- --rag-only`, live, no manual owner:**
  `cases=44`, **unsupported_correct_rate=1.0**, **citation_failure_rate=0.0455**,
  **numeric_grounding_failure_rate=0.0227** — all three invariants identical to #343's live
  baseline; `grounded_supported_rate=0.90` (vs #343 `0.9333`). The 5 failing cases are entirely in
  #343's documented live-variance set: 2 pure latency-threshold failures (this cloud env's
  Supabase p95 ≈ 49 s — the local→remote latency #343 called out) and 3 route/retrieval flakes
  (`illegal-substances`, `discharge-documentation`, `community-admission`) that #343 already
  identified as pre-existing variance outside the touched paths. Because this change is eval-config
  only (owner resolution) and touches no answer-generation code, the identical invariant rates
  confirm the part-2 decomposition preserved answer behavior. **#347 part-2 eval debt now fully
  settled** (retrieval half via #348, answer-path half here).

## Answer-thread Back button: URL and visible answer can disagree (2026-07-06)

- **Behaviour:** inside an Answer thread, browser Back changes the URL (`/?mode=answer&q=A&run=1` ← `...q=B&run=1`) but the rendered answer/thread does not change. Two guards produce this: the auto-run effect skips when `run=1` is already present, and the answer view early-returns when an answer is already on screen (`ClinicalDashboard`). This is thread persistence by design, not an accident — clearing the thread on Back would destroy in-progress clinical context.
- **Open product decision:** either (a) accept that the URL is not a faithful pointer to the visible answer inside a thread (current state), or (b) make Back restore the previous question's answer from thread history. Option (b) needs answer-thread state keyed by URL and re-render on `popstate`/param change; it is a deliberate feature, not a bug fix.
- **Guardrail until decided:** do not "fix" the skipped auto-run on Back in isolation — re-running the search on Back would clobber the visible thread with a regenerated (and possibly different) answer, which is worse than either deliberate option.

## Audit re-triage & property-test suite (2026-07-06)

- **Full re-triage of the 2026-07-01 audit's H1–H4 and M1–M17 against current main: all 21 are closed.** The 2026-07-02 remediation branch landed (H1/H2/H4+M8+M16, M1–M12, M14, M15, M17 all carry audit-referencing fixes verified in code, not just comments); PR #278 added the P0 carry-over (including the M9 DELETE TOCTOU re-check); M13's migration (`20260702000000`) is in-tree (live-apply verification needs `npm run check:m13-migration` with live keys). H3 is closed by supersession: PR #118 removed the governance penalties it complained about entirely (measured, "do not reintroduce" comment in `retrieval-selection.ts`); the residual `Math.max` floor only affects intent boosts, and un-flooring it was already tried and withdrawn (compounding across selection passes — audit R1). Do not re-open H3 without the golden retrieval eval.
- **New fast-check property suite** (`tests/property-*.test.ts`) pins the text-processing core's clinical invariants over generated inputs: unit-bearing numeric tokens survive sanitization; chunking terminates (including `CHUNK_OVERLAP >= CHUNK_SIZE`, M17) and neither loses nor invents content; table normalization stays rectangular, preserves numeric values, and the low-confidence caveat survives both clipboard export paths (H4). The suite immediately caught a live line-level H2 residue in `stripLowYieldLines` (control markers glued to threshold sentences deleted the whole line), fixed in the same PR.
- **Eval debt (blocking merge of the sanitizer fix, not development):** the environment had no live Supabase/OpenAI keys, so `npm run eval:quality -- --rag-only` (answer-path gate for the sanitizer change) could not run. Run it before merging `claude/audit-sweep-property-tests`. No retrieval-selection/ranking files were touched, so the golden retrieval eval is not required for this branch.

## Differentials export "Urgency: urgent" artifact retitled — live prune pending (2026-07-11)

- The differentials export's trap-tables appendix (`T_Focused_Diagnostic_Trap_Tables.txt`) has no title line, so the parser surfaced its first metadata row ("Urgency: urgent") as a presentation titled "Urgency: urgent" (slug `urgency-urgent`) with detail routes and search visibility. It is a legitimate comparison workflow ("Distinguishes intrusive/obsessional phenomena from psychotic or violent intent"), and 4 of its 7 option diagnoses (`gad-worry-depressive-rumination`, `overvalued-idea`, `psychotic-delusion`, `ptsd-intrusive-memories-flashbacks`) exist in no other entry — so excluding it would orphan them and break the #483 invariant (enforced by `differential-detail.test.ts`) that every diagnosis belongs to a presentation. Fixed at the root: `parseEntryTitle` now falls back to the `=== HEADER ===` text when the first line is a metadata row, retitling the entry "Focused Diagnostic Trap Tables" (slug `focused-diagnostic-trap-tables`). Snapshot stays 31 presentations; no orphans.
- **Operator follow-up (live Supabase, confirmation-required):** the retitle changed the slug, and seeding upserts by slug and never deletes, so already-seeded owners keep the stale `differential_records` row (`kind='presentation'`, `slug='urgency-urgent'`) and — where corpus embedding ran — its registry corpus document/chunks in `documents`/`document_chunks`. `npm run differentials:seed -- --owner-id <uuid> --write` now prunes presentation rows whose slug the current snapshot no longer produces (via `staleSeededPresentations`) and their corpus documents per owner; run it for each seeded owner.

## 2026-07-13 audit remediation batch (branch claude/audit-remediation-2026-07-13)

- **Lexical retrieval rewrite (audit finding 1):** `20260713100000_index_friendly_lexical_retrieval.sql` splits `match_document_chunks_text`'s OR-across-relations candidate search into two GIN-index probes unioned by chunk id (same contract, same scores; the `_v2` wrapper inherits the speedup). Parity + plan + timing harness: `scripts/sql/lexical-rpc-parity-check.sql` (scratch databases only; run it against the drift-manifest container kept with `--keep`). Re-run it whenever either lexical body changes.
- **Hosted migration-role default privileges (audit finding 7):** `supabase/roles.sql` establishes and verifies secure `postgres` defaults before fresh local migration replay. `20260717161000_assert_postgres_default_privileges.sql` evaluates effective defaults from `pg_default_acl` plus `acldefault`, so a missing catalog row cannot hide PostgreSQL's built-in `PUBLIC EXECUTE` on functions. `20260717173000_reassert_postgres_default_privileges.sql` repeats the fail-closed postcondition, and `20260719053532_repair_postgres_default_privileges.sql` is the forward-only hosted repair immediately before the final title-word scope migration. All active revokes and assertions target objects created by `postgres` in `public`; service-role grants remain least-privilege. Older applied migration history is immutable and byte-pinned by `npm run check:migration-role`; the same guard rejects the reserved role in every other hosted SQL/tooling surface. Bare Docker recovery discovers the storage-schema owner dynamically, keeping that local bootstrap concern out of hosted SQL. After an authorized hosted apply, run the read-only provider check with `npm run check:default-acl -- --confirm-provider-read`. This command contacts the live Supabase project and therefore requires explicit provider approval.
- **Legacy rag query text scrub (audit finding 5):** `20260713103000_scrub_legacy_rag_query_text.sql` performs four redaction/deletion operations for pre-HMAC plaintext query text: (1) scrubs `rag_queries.query` rows not matching `redacted-query:%`, replacing them with salted `redacted-query:legacy:` placeholders; (2) scrubs both `rag_query_misses.query` and `rag_query_misses.normalized_query` not matching `redacted-query:%`; (3) scrubs both `rag_retrieval_logs.query` and `rag_retrieval_logs.normalized_query` not matching `redacted-query:%` (nullable); (4) deletes `rag_response_cache` rows where `normalized_query` does not match `redacted-cache:%` (cache entries, not re-keyed). **Operator verification after live apply:** for each affected table/operation, count rows not matching the expected redacted pattern (expect 0 unless `RAG_PERSIST_RAW_QUERY_TEXT` is deliberately enabled): `select count(*) from rag_queries where query not like 'redacted-query:%';` (expect 0), `select count(*) from rag_query_misses where query not like 'redacted-query:%' or normalized_query not like 'redacted-query:%';` (expect 0), `select count(*) from rag_retrieval_logs where query not like 'redacted-query:%' or (normalized_query is not null and normalized_query not like 'redacted-query:%');` (expect 0), `select count(*) from rag_response_cache where normalized_query not like 'redacted-cache:%';` (expect 0). The migration includes a post-apply assertion block that enforces these exact checks and fails the migration if any unscrubbed/undeleted rows remain.
- Remaining operator items from the 2026-07-13 audit (confirmation-required, not automated): apply this batch's migrations live, re-run Supabase advisors, trigger the Eval Canary and require two consecutive green scheduled runs, repair the invalid `storage.idx_objects_bucket_id_name_lower` index via dashboard/support, and dedupe response-cache purge cron jobs if `cron.job` shows duplicates.

## Repo-productivity & automation tooling (2026-07-13)

Machinery added to retire repeated traps and surface live-product signal proactively. This entry is
the durable index for the tooling; `docs/operator-backlog.md` tracks the human-only enablement steps.

- **Pre-push guards** (`.githooks/pre-push` → `scripts/guard-push.mjs`, auto-installed by the
  `postinstall` → `scripts/install-git-hooks.mjs`, which sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks`): five guards.
  The non-bypassable auto-merge ownership guard blocks a push on every PR branch when the PR's
  auto-merge is armed. The other guards retain explicit overrides: format-before-push (closes the `verify:cheap` vs
  CI `format:check` gap; it reuses only an exact-lock worktree dependency tree and otherwise blocks
  with `npm ci --include=dev`; `SKIP_FORMAT_GUARD=1`), and static gate (changed-file lint + source-only typecheck through the run
  coordinator; `SKIP_STATIC_GUARD=1`). `guard:push:self-test` covers the pure logic. Because the SessionStart hook is remote-gated, the
  installer runs from `postinstall` (any new npm lifecycle script must also be COPY'd into the
  Dockerfile npm-ci stages — see the 2026-07-13 docs-infra note).
- **Stale-base tripwire** (`scripts/check-base-freshness.mjs`, `check:base-freshness`): advisory
  ahead/behind-vs-`origin/main` warning wired into a second SessionStart hook; never blocks.
- **Live-product monitoring:** `spend` block on `/api/health?deep=1` (`src/lib/observability/spend-metrics.ts`,
  USD derived from already-persisted answer token counts; prices via `OPENAI_PRICE_*` env, placeholders
  until set). `scripts/ops-digest.mjs` + `.github/workflows/ops-digest.yml` (**dispatch-only** until
  `PROD_HEALTH_URL` var + `HEALTH_DEEP_PROBE_SECRET` secret exist in both Railway and GitHub).
- **Ingestion autopilot** (`scripts/ingestion-autopilot.ts`, `ingestion:autopilot`): probes `reindex-health`
  and recovers a stuck queue **only** with `--apply`. Workflow schedule is LIVE in **dry-run**
  (`INGESTION_AUTOPILOT_APPLY` unset → read-only); flip that repo var to `true` after a clean dry-run to
  allow real recovery.
- **CI failure triage** (`.github/workflows/ci-triage.yml`): on PR CI failure, classifies each failed job
  as main-side or needs-investigation. Enabled by default; set repo var `CI_TRIAGE_ENABLED=false` to disable. UI jobs use
  their uploaded JUnit classification and trace; job names alone never produce a known-flake verdict.
  The workflow reads only trusted default-branch job metadata and never runs PR code.
- **PR metadata policy** (`.github/workflows/pr-policy.yml`, `scripts/pr-policy.mjs`): ready PRs to `main`
  must use an outcome-focused title, complete Summary and Verification evidence, and provide risk/rollback
  evidence for clinical or operationally sensitive paths. UI changes require `verify:ui` evidence (or an
  explicit reason it could not run), while clinical-risk changes must fully disposition the governance
  checklist. `scripts/pr-policy.mjs` also flags operational risk bundled with clinical or UI risk (#178),
  warning authors to split infrastructure/tooling from clinical/UI features for independent revertibility.
  The `pull_request_target` job checks out the trusted `github.workflow_sha` revision, has
  read-only permissions, and never executes PR-head code. Drafts remain non-blocking until marked ready; merge-queue runs emit the
  same stable `PR policy` check name.
- **Default-branch failure attribution** (`scripts/ci-triage.mjs`): triage now compares a failed PR only
  with the latest completed run of the same workflow on `main`. It no longer samples the latest arbitrary
  repository workflow, which could incorrectly label a PR failure as main-side. A main-side label remains
  routing evidence only; it never suppresses the required failure.
- **Repository permission baseline (applied 2026-07-17):** Actions receive read-only tokens by default,
  cannot approve pull requests, and must reference external actions by immutable SHA. Workflows that post
  issues/comments retain narrow explicit permissions. Secret-scanning push protection is enabled and
  merged branches are deleted automatically. Non-provider pattern scanning and credential-validity checks
  remain unavailable for this user-owned repository/plan, so the ordinary secret scan, push protection,
  Gitleaks check, and local secret-surface guards remain the active layers.
- **Review-routing labels (applied 2026-07-17):** `codex-review` is the explicit opt-in for a normally
  low-risk PR, and `skip-codex-review` is the unconditional opt-out. Four obsolete per-head `codex-ar-*`
  labels from the retired routing mechanism were removed after confirming no open PR used them.
- **Repo hygiene:** `check:env-parity` (env-var NAME reconciliation across `env.ts`, `check-ci-env.mjs`,
  and — opt-in, names-only — `gh secret list` / Railway).
- **Session skills** (`.claude/skills/{newtask,handoff,prlanded}`): the first repo-local skills, encoding
  the clean-worktree, upload, and post-merge-verification rituals.
- **CI guards (warn/advisory):** `check:bundle-budget` (warn-only client-JS size gate after Build until a
  baseline is captured in `bundle-budget.json` and `enforce:true` is set) and `docs:check-scripts`
  (advisory — validates `npm run` refs in docs against `package.json`).
