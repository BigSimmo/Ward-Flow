# Ward Flow — autonomous session, 2026-08-28

**The product owner is away for 12+ hours and has authorised full autonomy** to complete Phase 7, then
plan and complete Phase 8, then Phase 9 if time allows — making decisions myself, grounded in the
repository and in what is already recorded about how he works.

This file is the audit trail he reads when he returns, and the recovery map if this session is
interrupted or its context is compacted. **It is maintained as work proceeds, not written at the end.**

---

## 1. What I will decide, and what I will not

### Decisions I will make and record

Product and design choices where the repository, the roadmap, or a prior owner decision gives me
adequate grounding: screen layout and copy, which existing pattern to follow, task ordering, how to
close a review finding, what to seed in a fixture, naming, and the smallest correct verification for a
change. Each is recorded in §4 with its reasoning and what it would cost to reverse.

### Decisions I will NOT make, whatever the pressure to keep moving

1. **Anything requiring a fact neither of us has** — clinical, legal, or about how a real Western
   Australian service actually operates. I will not guess and I will not smuggle a guess into a default.
   Where one is needed, the design states the gap explicitly, keeps it cheap to fill, and the question
   goes to §5 for him to answer. This is the rule that produced the best decisions of the last two
   phases; it does not lapse because he is asleep.
2. **Never invent a legal figure.** No figure, timeframe, threshold or duration from the Mental Health
   Act, anywhere — code, copy, comment, test or fixture. A plain Voluntary/Involuntary label is
   permitted and is not a legal figure. Absolute, and not a matter of judgement.
3. **No real patient data, ever.** Synthetic only. No free text anywhere in a referral.
4. **Nothing leaves this machine.** No push, no pull request, no GitHub write of any kind. He authorised
   building, not publishing, and the repository's own rules require explicit confirmation for provider
   or hosted actions. Every commit stays local on `claude/ward-flow-phases-6-7-design`.
5. **No provider-backed command** — never `verify:release`, any `eval:*`, `check:supabase-project`,
   `test:live`, or anything touching OpenAI, Supabase, hosted CI or a live database.
6. **Nothing destructive.** No `git stash` (the stack is shared across worktrees and holds other
   people's work), no force-push, no reset, no worktree deletion, no touching another session's files.
7. **No gate skipped, no assertion deleted, no test loosened, no tolerance lowered.** If a change would
   reduce what can honestly be claimed, I do not make it — I record it instead.

## 2. The plan

| Phase                          | State                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **7 — the front door**         | Tasks 1–3 built and reviewed. Task 2a (fourth field) in flight. Then: the review fix round, the two screens, registration, browser proof, screenshots, and the morning page's people-waiting figure. |
| **8 — distance and the state** | Questions document drafted. Plan to be perfected as Phase 7 closes, then built.                                                                                                                      |
| **9 — daily use and trust**    | Planned only as Phase 8 closes, deliberately — most of it attaches to Phase 7's referral queue, which has changed shape twice during its own build.                                                  |

Working method throughout: subagent-driven development. One implementer at a time in this worktree (the
pre-commit hook inspects the whole tree, so two agents cannot commit independently); read-only reviewers
may run concurrently. Every task gets a brief, a report, a review, and a fix round where the review
finds anything.

**Every new test is mutation-tested** — the behaviour it guards is deliberately broken, the test watched
to go red, the failure line quoted, and the source restored byte-identically. Phase 6 found **ten** tests
that looked like they guarded something and did not. That is why this is not optional.

## 4. Decisions I made on his behalf

Appended as they happen. Each states what I decided, why, and what it costs if wrong.

### A1 — I committed Task 5 myself instead of re-dispatching it

Its implementing agent stopped after launching its mutation batch, before writing a report or
committing. The work itself was finished. I read all four mutations out of the log, re-ran the
gates myself (160 tests across six ward suites, lint, typecheck), and committed it as `8874d0c07`.

**Why.** Re-dispatching would have re-run finished work, which this project's own record names as
the most expensive failure it has had. The alternative — waking the agent — would have cost a
further large slice of its context to reach the same commit.

**If wrong:** nothing is lost. The commit is reviewable in full and a review is running against it.

### A2 — I pinned the Task 5 review to the commit rather than the working tree

The reviewer reads every file under review with `git show 8874d0c07:<path>`, never from disk.

**Why.** The previous review had to open by saying it ran nothing, because the tree was mid-edit
by another agent and any run would have failed for unrelated reasons. Pinning removes that
constraint, so Task 6's registration work runs at the same time instead of after — the first safe
parallelisation this phase has had.

**If wrong:** the reviewer misses a working-tree-only problem. Task 8's screenshot sweep and the
final whole-branch review both read the tree, so nothing is lost permanently.

### A3 — I left the ward-board design spec alone

A separate local session committed `bc49a1820` to this branch: a design specification and
implementation plan for a ward board, written with the product owner across three rounds of
questions on 2026-08-28. It is documentation only, and it states its own hard sequencing
constraint — no task in it may begin until Phase 7's build is complete, because its first three
tasks modify the files Phase 7's remaining tasks own.

**Why.** It is his work with another session, it does not conflict, and its constraint matches
mine. I have not started any of it and will not until Phase 7 closes.

**If wrong:** nothing — I changed nothing.

**Two lists in it are marked owner-pending and must not be invented by an agent:** the
blocked-discharge reasons and the receiving-window options at the pull. I will not fill either.

---

## 5. Questions I did not answer, and why

Appended as they arise. These are the ones that need a fact neither of us has.

- **Still owed, and unchanged since Phase 5:** the four-stage bed model
  (`predicted → confirmed → blocked → released`) has never been checked by a ward clinician.
  `docs/ward-flow-clinician-check.md` is the one-page summary waiting to go out. Phase 6 was built so
  that being wrong costs three strings; Phase 7 so that it costs nothing at all. Phases 8 and 9 must be
  designed to the same standard. **This remains the cheapest, highest-value thing available and only he
  can do it.**

- **New, found by this session's legal-figure sweep on 2026-08-28 — the transport and transfer
  forms still carry deadlines nobody has verified.** On 2026-08-23 you corrected this model so that
  neither a Form 1A nor a Form 3B carries a due time, because the figure an earlier agent had
  written in came from its own recollection rather than from you or a clinician. That correction
  was deliberately scoped, and `LegalForm`'s own doc comment says so: the transport and transfer
  forms — 4A and 4C — were "out of scope for this correction" and still carry due times. Four of
  them sit in the fixture today.

  The screens render a passed due time in danger red, as the one line a coordinator must not miss.
  So the prototype currently shows a statutory-looking countdown against two real form numbers on
  the strength of the same kind of unverified figure you removed from the other two.

  **Nothing has been changed.** It is outside Phase 7 and it is a legal question, which is yours.
  Three ways it could go: the figures trace back to you or a clinician and stay; they do not, and
  they are removed exactly as 1A and 3B were; or the forms keep a due time that is explicitly
  labelled as invented. **I will not choose between those.**

- **A stale comment asserting a deadline that no longer exists.** `coordinator.module.css` still
  explains its danger styling by saying one movement outranks another "because its Form 1A deadline
  has already passed". After your 2026-08-23 correction no Form 1A carries a deadline, so the
  comment describes behaviour the code can no longer produce. Harmless to a user, misleading to the
  next agent that reads it — which is how the original wrong figure got in. Left alone because the
  file belongs to no Phase 7 task and another session is working nearby; it is a one-line fix
  whenever anyone is next in that file.

---

- **The home-region field is finer-grained than the option you approved, and this is worth your eye
  now rather than later.** When you answered P8-1 you chose option B, described in the question as
  "the same coarse grouping already shown on every screen — North Metro, East Metro, South Metro, or
  country", and its stated justification was that it is "too broad to point at any individual".

  What was built is the ten Western Australian regions: Perth Metropolitan, Peel, South West, Great
  Southern, Wheatbelt, Goldfields-Esperance, Mid West, Gascoyne, Pilbara, Kimberley. That is a
  reasonable, standard grouping and it is certainly not an address — but it is finer than four, and
  in the sparsest regions a region plus an age band plus a sex is a good deal narrower than the
  option text promised. It also does not line up with the five health services the rest of the
  system uses, which is a second, purely practical mismatch.

  **Nothing about this is a live privacy problem** — every referral in this prototype is invented.
  It matters because it is your governance decision that drifted between being taken and being
  built, and because it is much cheaper to settle before Phase 8 authors travel-time data against
  ten regions than after.

  Three ways it can go, and it is entirely yours: keep ten regions and record that you meant the
  finer grouping; collapse to the four you approved; or keep ten for travel time and show only the
  coarse four anywhere a region appears beside a person. **I have changed nothing.**

- **Five freshness windows nobody recorded a source for, and the guard cannot see them.** Phase 7's
  final review found the match view calling a bed "stale" while the morning page calls the same ward
  "confirmed". Asked to investigate rather than change it, the fix round found three things worth
  your attention:

  The word "stale" rests on a threshold, and there is no single threshold — there are **five**,
  hand-written into the site fixture per figure: 15 and 20 minutes on the emergency-department feed
  figures, and 60, 90 and 120 minutes on the ward figures. **None of them has any record of who chose
  it.**

  Worse, the guard that exists to catch exactly this **structurally cannot see them.** It inspects
  exported declarations in one file; these are properties inside object literals in a different file.
  So the mechanism that was built to stop an unrecorded number entering the model reports clean while
  five unrecorded numbers sit outside its reach.

  To be fair to it: these are bed-data freshness windows, not Mental Health Act figures, so no legal
  prohibition has been broken. But they are the same _shape_ as the Form 1A deadline you removed — a
  number nobody can trace, doing work on a clinical screen.

  There is also a plain inconsistency underneath: the morning page's freshness roll-up never reads
  those windows at all, which is why it can say "23 of 23 wards confirmed" about a ward the match
  view is refusing as stale. The numbers agree; only the language differs.

  **Nothing has been changed.** Three ways it could go, and it is yours: record where the five windows
  came from and keep them; replace them with one window you choose and label it as the prototype's
  own; or drop the word "stale" from the screen and state the elapsed time only. **I did not choose,
  because closing it alters what a coordinator is told on a clinical surface either way.**

## 6. If this session is interrupted

Trust this file and `git log` over any recollection. The execution ledgers name every commit. Resume at
the first task in §2 without a completion line in its ledger. Do not re-dispatch a task the ledger
records as complete — a controller that lost its place and re-ran finished work is the most expensive
failure this project has recorded.

---

## 7. Things I am adding that were not asked for

Each is here because the session's own record says it is worth the time.

**A reliability gate at every phase boundary.** A local production build plus the full offline unit
suite, lint, typecheck and formatting, run once when a phase closes rather than after every task. The
build matters specifically: two defect classes in this project — a wrong Server/Client boundary, and a
missing icon entry that crashed every screen — are invisible to tests and visible only to a real build
or a real page load. All local; none provider-backed.

**Look at every screen before calling a phase done.** Ten tests in Phase 6 passed while the behaviour
they named was broken, and the defects that actually reached the rendered page — hospital names missing
from print, five bold zeros under a real hospital's name, a five-page sheet that promised one — were
each found by rendering the page and looking, never by a test. Screenshots at 390, 820 and 1440 plus
the print rendering, for every new screen.

**A running defect ledger rather than a tally at the end.** Every defect found, what class it was, and
what would have caught it earlier. Phase 6's most useful output was not the page; it was learning that
a hand-maintained list a type change cannot reach is this repository's most reliable way to ship a
silent failure. That pattern has now appeared four times: the Playwright spec regex, the nav icon map,
the route-coverage map, and the emergency department's cohort picker.

**Explicit statements of what is NOT proven.** Every phase summary says what was proven by a test I
watched fail, what was proven by looking at the screen, and what is neither. A hedge is worth less than
an honest gap.

**No pushing, no pull request.** Stated again because it is the boundary most easily eroded by a long
autonomous run. He authorised building, not publishing. Everything stays local on this branch, and the
morning summary will say exactly what is committed and where.
